The educational department of South China's Guangdong Province Monday said it considers derogatory nicknames and cyber violence as school bullying. A school bully is someone who intentionally and maliciously causes physical, financial or mental harm to others through speech, physical or online abuse, regardless of whether it is done in or out of school, according to a regulation published on the Guangdong Province education department's website. It said school bullying includes giving others derogatory nicknames and degrading others on social media with language or images.  Students involved in serious bullying incidents could be sent to special schools for correction education, the regulation said. The regulation applies to all elementary and secondary students, as well as those in technician training schools in Guangdong Province. Schools should create committees to investigate and determine if a case constitutes school bullying within 10 days, the document said. Wan Daqiang, a Beijing-based lawyer who specializes in child protection, told the Global Times that China lacked detailed regulations on school bullying management, which led to an increase in such cases, some deadly. A girl in her first year in middle school jumped from a building in January in South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Local police found the girl's notes that said she had been bullied by classmates.    "We usually give others nicknames to make fun of them, but neglect the long-lasting influence on them," Wan noted.The State Council's Education Supervision Committee in April launched an anti-bullying campaign in middle and primary schools.The committee will release a summary of the campaign in late November, according to an announcement on the Ministry of Education website.Newspaper headline: Mocking nicknames listed as school bullying Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Oil price climbs after Saudi Arabia announces plan to cut productionSenior Chinese lottery officials confess to corruption, repent in videoSinger Kris Wu's US iTunes success showcases a lack of understanding of Chinese fan culture CA voters say nation headed wrong wayDemocrat Newsom elected next governor of CaliforniaUC strike How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
