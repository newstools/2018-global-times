Chinese police hand over Nong Wenqi on Monday in South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Photo: Guo YuandanChinese police handed over an internationally wanted Vietnamese drug trafficker, who allegedly masterminded an operation involving 100 kilograms of heroin, on Monday in South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.It was the first handover of a wanted person on the Interpol Red Notice between the two countries this year. China's border with Vietnam is one of the main routes of drug trafficking into China. "The two countries have more practical cooperation in cracking down on drug cases. We now exchange information and evidence, and have also launched joint detection," Zhao Wanpeng, police officer at the Embassy of China in Vietnam, told the Global Times on Monday.A total of 536 Vietnam-related drug cases have been cracked as of November 1, and 741 suspects have been arrested, including 43 Vietnamese, with more than 250 kilograms of drugs seized.The internationally wanted drug dealer - who went by Nong Wenqi in previous Chinese reports - was arrested on October 25 in Huizhou, South China's Guangdong Province after he entered China through Guangxi in February.Vietnam police informed China in May and officially applied for China's help in arresting and handing over the suspect in August.Nong escaped Vietnam after Vietnamese police cracked down on his drug operations on February 23 and arrested five people and seized 288 bricks of heroin weighing a total of 100.8 kilograms.Nong was reportedly paid 5,000 yuan ($721) for each brick of heroin he smuggled into China, which normally weighs 350 grams per piece, a Guangxi police officer told the Global Times. Nong had three wives in Vietnam and bought a piece of land. But because he had no money in China, he worked at a furniture factory in Huizhou, where he was subsequently arrested.Police of the two countries will continue working together to fight drug trafficking, Ruan Dinan, in Chinese, deputy head of the anti-drug bureau of the Ministry of Public Security of Vietnam, told the Global Times.
