The Reagan arrived in HKSAR at about 11:25 am, according to information provided by the Marine Department of the HKSAR government, which was released on Wednesday on its website. US destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur, USS Benfold and cruiser USS Chancellorsville were also expected to dock in Hong Kong, local news website hkcd.com reported Wednesday. Chinese military experts said that the warships will be resupplied and their crews will be given shore leave.Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Wednesday that allowing the US warships to dock in HKSAR is a barometer indicating the state of relations between the two militaries. China turned down an application by the US amphibious assault ship Wasp to enter HKSAR in September amid trade frictions between the two countries and US sanction against a Chinese military agency and its head for allegedly buying Russian fighter jets and a surface-to-air missile system, Reuters reported in September.The Reagan was allowed to visit HKSAR in October last year, hkcd.com said in the report.Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday that allowing the US aircraft carrier and its support ships to dock in HKSAR signals China's willingness to seek an improvement in a wide range of ties between the two countries."Military relations are a crucial part to the overall ties between China and the US," Li said.Li said there are frictions and mistrust between the two sides, but leaders from the two countries are keeping communication channels open, which is helping ease tensions.

It is relatively straightforward to use the countries' militaries as icebreakers, Li noted.
