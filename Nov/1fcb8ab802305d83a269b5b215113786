"As long as we damage the enemy ship's key structure like the command center, armory or engine room, it is enough for us to get the upper hand so that we can follow up," he said.Su said that an unmanned surface vessel is significantly cost-efficient compared to a traditional naval ship. Because it is unmanned, no operator casualty will occur.The company claims that Look Out II is the first unmanned missile boat made in China and the second in the world. The first was developed by Israel.The development of Look Out II indicates that China is globally competitive in making unmanned surface vehicles and is of significant strategic meaning as China did not have such vessels in the past, the company said.Look Out II conducted its first missile test in late October. It successfully hit the target at the first attempt, the statement said.Su said that while the drone can automatically sail the sea and choose optimal routes with artificial intelligence (AI), the use of weapons is still done manually through remote control."We cannot have AI determine the life and death of humans," Su said.In June Yunzhou conducted a test in which 56 unmanned boats formed a formation dubbed a "shark swarm."Su said that Look Out II can use a similar tactic or even team up with naval drones with other capabilities.The company is already offering unmanned boats capable of electromagnetic countermeasures, patroling, escort and reconnaissance, Su said. "The user can form different formations according to the situation on the battlefield," he said.Military experts said a large number of armed unmanned surface vehicles can overwhelm enemy vessels.Yunzhou is eager to deliver its products to the People's Liberation Army. Foreign countries including Namibia have also expressed interest, according to the statement.
