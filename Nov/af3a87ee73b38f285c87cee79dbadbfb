The symposium on private enterprises presided over on Thursday by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, has instilled confidence in the country's private businesses and cleared doubts over the prospects of China's non-public sector that has been contributing significantly to the country's economic growth, said business representatives and economists on Friday.Xi, also Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, said Thursday China will unswervingly encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public sector and support private enterprises to develop toward a broader stage, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Thursday. Xi noted during a symposium on private enterprises that the basic economic system of retaining a dominant position for the public sector together with developing diverse forms of ownership is an important part of the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and crucial to improving the socialist market economy, according to Xinhua. The non-public sector's status and functions in the country's economic and social development have not changed. The principle and policies to unswervingly encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public sector have not changed, and the principle and policies to provide a sound environment and more opportunities to the sector have not changed either, Xi said."On the new journey to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects and further fully build a modern socialist China, our country's private sector should only grow stronger instead of being weakened and march toward a broader stage," Xi said.The symposium came at a time when some private companies have been struggling to generate more revenue and tackling rising debt. There has been also heated discussion about whether private companies have already completed their historic mission, and that it may be time for them to withdraw, casting a shadow over the prospects of the non-public sector.The symposium clearly sent out a message that the Party and the central government highly recognize the value of China's private companies, and measures should be effectively implemented to address their problems, Feng Liguo, a research fellow at China Minsheng Bank's research center, told the Global Times. "Given some issues highlighted during the symposium, local governments and officials should avoid a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, which jeopardizes the interests of private business owners," he said. China's non-public sector now contributes more than 60 percent of China's GDP growth and brings in over half of China's fiscal revenue, Gao Yunlong, head of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, was quoted as saying in media reports in March. The sector also provides over 80 percent of the jobs, Xinhua reported.By the end of 2017, there were 65.79 million individually-owned businesses and 27.26 million private enterprises in China, which employed 340 million people, Xinhua reported. However, more than 800 listed private companies saw soaring pledged shares as of the end of October, reflecting rising debt risks, Feng noted.  During the symposium, Xi demanded the implementation of policies and measures in six aspects to create a better environment for the development of private enterprises and to address their difficulties, Xinhua said. Also, 10 entrepreneurs who attended the symposium shared their views and offered suggestions on private enterprise development. Four of them, such as Liu Jiren, CEO of major Chinese software firm Neusoft, and Tang Xiao'ou, founder of artificial intelligence (AI)-focused firm SenseTime, come from  the information technology sector. "Private companies and State-owned enterprises should work together to boost global cooperation in AI," Tang was quoted as saying in a note sent to the Global Times. Business representatives who attended the symposium considered Xi's speech inspiring and encouraging, particularly at the time when the private sector is facing difficulty amid the economic downward pressure. "Top leadership highly valued the contributions made by private companies to the country's reforms and opening-up, and China's non-public sector is also a global treasury, as it has the full supply chain," Zhang Huarong, a Chinese entrepreneur who also attended the meeting, told the Global Times.
