He also noted that the three buildings discovered at the site are presented as Siheyuan, a historic type of courtyard surrounded by buildings on all four sides.Ma said the relic dates back 4,400 to 4,500 years ago and linked the site to that term."It shows the transformation of Chinese settlements from the early to middle stages, forming different social classes during this time," Ma said.Ma pointed it out that the social stratum division displayed by the relic is the essential element of civilization, which significantly reflects the evolution of Chinese prehistoric society.Covering an area of 2 million square meters, the Lushanmao site, is one of the largest prehistoric settlements in China, the Xinhua News Agency reported in January.Shaanxi provincial cultural heritage bureau announced in January that archaeologists discovered housing and cooking sites and city walls at the site.
