ASEAN member states on Monday signed an agreement on e-commerce that will enable cross-border transactions, which Singapore's minister of trade said will further boost the already rapidly expanding use of e-commerce in the region.The signing ceremony of the ASEAN Agreement on E-Commerce was held during the 33th ASEAN summit and related summits in Singapore, which runs from November 11-16.Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry of Singapore, said at the ceremony that the agreement will help bolster the trust and confidence of ASEAN consumers in e-commerce and drive its use. "In doing so, we will enable ASEAN businesses to grow domestically, regionally and globally," said Chan.Chan noted that the region's e-commerce potential has lured many foreign entrants to set up in the region, including Amazon and Alibaba. More significantly is the rise of ASEAN-grown startups valued at more than a billion dollars such as Lazada of Singapore and Tokopedia of Indonesia that have a sizeable presence in the regional e-commerce market today.Many shops in Singapore are currently using mobile e-payment including China's Alipay and WeChat, which are offering consumers small rebates on each transaction. According to a report titled e-Conomy 2025 Southeast Asia, published by Google and Temasek in 2017, ASEAN is the world's fastest growing internet market, with 330 million internet users. By 2025, ASEAN's internet economy is set to quadruple to $200 billion from $50 billion in 2017 with e-commerce expected to grow to $88 billion.
