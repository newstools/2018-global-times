Luca Iandimarino, head of the investment center of Life Bankers, advisory network of BNL - the Italian subsidiary of French international banking group BNP Paribas - said the delegation is seeking to diversify investments and portfolio risks. "We have a lot of clients that need to invest and diversify the portfolio," said Iandimarino - who is leading the Italian delegation - during an informative event held at the Italian Embassy in Beijing. "China, for us is a great opportunity to diversify the asset allocation of the clients that are mostly focused on Europe."Chinese President Xi Jinping announced at this year's Boao Forum for Asia in April that China will reform its financial sector, which was widely applauded by international financial agencies.China's financial system is resilient and stable amid mounting external uncertainties, as the country moved to resolve systemic risks, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a report released earlier this month.China is expected to unveil regulations on financial holding groups in the first half of 2019, according to the PBOC.Italy, though not considered a country short of infrastructure, is deemed an important partner in China's Belt and Road initiative (BRI). Giovanni Lovisetti, an Italian lawyer at Dezan Shira & Associates, which introduced the delegation to do business in China, said there is a growing number of Italian entrepreneurs and investors looking for BRI opportunities in the country."The presence of the numerous Italian bankers is a clear proof of this trend," he noted.

"Among the Task Force's main objectives are strengthening the relationship between China and Italy [in the fields of trade, finance, investment, R&D and cooperation in third countries], and guaranteeing Italy a position of leadership in Europe vis-à-vis China's Belt and Road and Made in China 2025 initiatives," Italy's Ministry of Economic Development said in a statement issued at the launch of the task force.Italy aims to be China's leading economic and trade partner in Europe and is open to becoming a Mediterranean transport hub for the BRI, the country's undersecretary of state for economic development Michele Geraci said in an interview with Chinese news portal Caixin in September.Proposed by China in 2013, the BRI refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which aims to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa, Xinhua News Agency reported. Asked whether Italy shares suspicions about Chinese investment like other European countries such as France and Germany, Geraci told Caixin, "We don't have these issues yet." "I don't think we will have it," he was quoted by Caixin as saying. "Italy is generally a very open economy."Trade between Italy and China amounted to around $49.6 billion last year, according to statistics published by the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Italian exports to China are also increasing by 22.2 percent growth year-on-year, with a much more positive outlook than imports.Newspaper headline: Banking on China Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Xinjiang companies sign multimillion-dollar dealsXi impresses with steamed bun lunchRural Chinese worker building the 'most authentic model of A320' from scratch Officials scramble for answers as flames continue to rageCalifornia fire death toll reaches 56; 130 missingCA voters say nation headed wrong way How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
