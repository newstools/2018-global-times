The world's first genome sequence on bread wheat has been completed with the help of Chinese scientists.The International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium successfully mapped the genome of "hexaploid bread wheat with an annotated reference sequence," according to a study released in the US-based academic journal Science on Friday.It marked the first time a hexaploid wheat genome sequence was completed, People's Daily reported Monday.Song Weining, a professor at Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University in Yangling, Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, and his team were part of the consortium and played an important role in the research.The Chinese team physically mapped the chromosome 7DL and analyzed its sequence. They also participated in analysis of the entire genome, Song told the Global Times on Monday."Wheat has 40 times more genomes than rice, and has more than 85 percent repetitive DNA, which made genome sequencing a challenge," he said.Wheat is the last important crop to see its genome fully sequenced. The research will help wheat adapt to dry land and saline-alkali soil as well as increase overall production in the future, according to Song.The sequencing can also contribute to wheat's resistance to diseases and pests, Science and Technology Daily reported on Monday.Wheat can also be developed to ensure fewer people suffer allergic reactions, the Beijing-based newspaper said."Our work is like a code book. It can provide a platform for future research to help with wheat breed," Song said.With wheat contributing about a fifth of the total calories consumed by humans, it is important to understand the wheat genome and develop improved varieties to avoid potential harvest failures and associated social unrest, the Science study said.
