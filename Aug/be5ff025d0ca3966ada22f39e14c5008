It is not surprising that China's Huawei has overtaken Apple to become the world's number two smartphone seller, as shown by second-quarter data from market research firms, said industry analysts. However, it might take a year or two to shake South Korean Samsung's status at the top.In the second quarter, Huawei delivered shipments of 54.2 million units of smartphones in the global market, up 40.9 percent year-on-year, with a record high market share of 15.8 percent, moving into the second position, following Samsung, with 71.5 million units shipped, according to recent data released by market research firm IDC."I thought that Huawei would beat Apple in smartphone shipment sooner or later. The day has come half a year earlier than I expected," James Yan, research director at Hong Kong-headquartered Counterpoint Research, told the Global Times Thursday.Huawei's mobile phones include high-, middle- and low-end products, while Apple's iPhones are concentrated at the high end, making it hard to compete with Huawei in large sales due to the high price, Yan noted.Wang Yanhui, head of the Shanghai-based Mobile China Alliance, said the ranking in terms of shipment is not what Apple cares about, since the firm is zealous in pursuing revenue.Yan said it will probably take one to two years for Huawei to overtake Samsung in the  global market as the latter has a solid edge in extensive global mapping and an ability to produce its own memory cards and displays, a key factor affecting supply and  sales.In its home market, Huawei was the fastest-growing brand registering a 22-percent year-on-year growth rate in the second quarter, while its sub-brand Honor individually surpassed domestic vendor Xiaomi in overall volume during the quarter, read a report by Counterpoint Research released on Monday.Huawei's flagships, the Huawei P20 and P20 Pro unveiled in April, satisfied the high market demand for smartphones priced between $600-800, and its new product, the  Honor 10, relayed the heat in May and June in online sales, attracting the market's attention for the entire quarter, said Wang Xi, an analyst with IDC."Huawei's overseas sales contributed a lot to its sales surge in the quarter with such markets as France, Spain and some Southeast Asian countries, as well as South American countries, posting strong growth," Yan noted.An overall mapping strategy on sales channels and marketing will help Huawei take root and develop rapidly in those markets amid the continuing global slowdown in smartphone shipments in the quarter, according to Yan.Looming tariff risksWang said there is still plenty of growth potential for Huawei, especially in the Indian market, where it had mediocre performance compared with other domestic brands like Xiaomi and OPPO."The ongoing trade row between China and the US has posed more difficulty for Huawei to enter the lucrative US market, which the Chinese tech firm had failed to do," Wang said.The threatening US tariffs are also worrying for Apple products made in China. The US firm said tariffs and other protectionist measures may "adversely affect" the company, according to its quarterly filing."Tariffs could increase the cost of the company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on sales of its products," it said.Newspaper headline: Huawei beats Apple in global sales Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Why Myanmar is concerned about Chinese investmentChina grasps rare chance to solve its Catholic problem during a unique papacy Ubiquitous surveillance cameras in a Beijing district reduce crimes by nearly 40% Equality of educational resources is a vital part in admission reformNew wildfires in CaliforniaWatermelon Festival How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
