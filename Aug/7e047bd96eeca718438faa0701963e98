Illustration: Chen Xia/GTI recently attended the ginormous Shanghai Book Fair at the sprawling Shanghai Exhibition Center. I was pleasantly surprised to see so many people - I'm talking thousands! - there every day. In particular, the children's books section was packed with parents and kids.You wouldn't guess it from all the phone zombies on the subways and sidewalks here, but Shanghai truly is a literary city - perhaps China's most literary. Beijing boasts a number of great authors, but I'd argue that a greater majority of the most celebrated Chinese authors throughout history were Shanghai-born.Some have high name recognition with foreign readers due to Shanghai's international stature, including Yan Geling and Han Han. Lu Xun (1881-1936), regarded as a leading figure of modern Chinese literature, is from neighboring Zhejiang Province, but eventually moved to Shanghai, where he was bequeathed a beautiful park in his name.Shanghai native Eileen Chang (1920-1995) is perhaps the city's most iconic writer. You will often see black-and-white portraits of her striking a pose in a silk qipao, and she is equally well-known in cinematic circles, especially for Ang Lee's controversial 2007 adaptation of her erotic spy novel, Lust, Caution.Chang's former residence of many years - and the cafe where she wrote some of her novels - is located around the corner from Jing'an Temple, at 195 Changde Road. It has become a pilgrimage site for Chang's modern-day fans, whom you can see sipping on coffee while browsing her works.Passing by that cafe while on my way to the Book Fair the other day, I asked myself why Shanghai has no literary walking tours? After all, Shanghai was once the cradle of China's New Culture Movement, reaching its zenith in the 1920s with an explosion of literary societies, newspapers and periodicals.There are many old homes here where some of China's most respected poets and authors penned their tomes, such as Li Yaotang (aka Ba Jin) (1904-2005), who lived at 113 Wukang Road, and Xu Zhimo (1897-1931), who lived at 913 Yan'an Middle Road.A 2009 Shanghai Daily article had the same gripe, saying "To date, however, there are no organized walking tours of literary Shanghai - you have to make your own way." Nine years later, there are no less than a dozen privately operated "city walks" in Shanghai, such as those specializing in Art Deco, but still none about its writers.According to a Global Times article in July, as part of its four new city brands, Shanghai has started to turn its featured historic city blocks into popular cultural tourism destinations by making historic buildings "readable" by scanning a QR code attached on these buildings. I hope they will do the same for its famous literary residences.Until then, I'm glad to know that the government is taking Shanghai's reputation as a literary city more seriously. In 2017, over 20 physical bookstores were opened and 20 more are expected to open later this year, according to Xu Jiong, head of Shanghai Municipal Press and Publication Bureau, at the physical bookstore innovation and development forum of the Shanghai Book Fair. Book retail sales in China totaled 80 billion yuan ($12 billion) in 2017, a 14-percent increase compared to 2016, according to a report by the Publishers Association of China.This boom follows a period of decline and dormancy for retail bookstores in Shanghai, many which were forced to close over the past five years due to rapidly rising rent. Fuzhou Road, known as Shanghai's "book street," suffered a number of closures in recent years, as did Huaihai Road, which was also home to several old bookshops.It would have been nice if Shanghai had saved these stores by offering them rent control, but at least the municipality is correcting this now by offering incentives to new bookstores. "Traditional brick-and-mortar outlets [in Shanghai] are back in vogue after being badly hit by the online sector," according to a February Asia Times article.This new chapter in Shanghai's bookstore renaissance will benefit from modernized features and millennial-enticing "lifestyle experiences," but promoting literacy through physical books should remain their foremost function.The opinions expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Global Times.
