The unprecedented China-US economic confrontation has provoked differing public opinions and even open disagreement among official Chinese scholars tasked with assessing and positing the best possible long-term national policy-making approach to escalating trade frictions.Some scholars support tit-for-tat, while others voice strong reservations about Chinese retaliation, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Some stand firmly against any unilateral compromise, arguing any concession would sacrifice China's fundamental rights to development."There is no winner in a trade war, but we should have faith that China will not tumble to a worse ground than the US, as we have the world's only and also the best manufacturing, supply-chain and a world-beating domestic market," Xiang Ligang, chief executive of telecom industry news site cctime.com, told the Global Times. Xiang predicted the trade war would take place within reasonable limits. Importers and farmers would force Washington to raise the white flag before things got out of hand, he said.Retaliation against Washington's bullying was the right thing to do to safeguard Beijing's national dignity as well as its overall interests, Xiang asserted.  In the opposing camp, Sun Liping, a sociology professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing published an article in March suggesting a trade war would surely deal a heavy blow to the US economy. But it would also test the very survival of the Chinese economy, Sun opined.Sun's pessimism was rooted in Beijing's reliance on external markets and recognizing that most of the foreign exchange that flows to China comes from the US. Neither the Xiang nor Sun camps fully represent the government policy-making process, said Li Haidong, the professor at China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing.So far policymakers have supported limited Chinese retaliation to US tariffs and stressed the stability of bilateral ties, Li said. That was "reasonable and respectful," Li said.The US is set to impose tariffs on a further $16 billion of Chinese goods on Thursday, and China has promised to respond in kind, Li said.Washington imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods in July, with Beijing immediately hitting back with its own package of 25 percent tariffs on 545 US products of $34 billion.
