Tesla Inc is ramping up efforts to build its gigafactory in Shanghai, as the US electric carmaker is reportedly in talks with Chinese banks to negotiate funding for its new facility and is recruiting staff in China. But Tesla could face tough questioning by Chinese investors about its financing and production plans and rising competition in the world's largest market for electric cars.Tesla is in talks with at least four large Chinese banks for funding, according to Bloomberg. The news came just a few hours after Tesla CEO Elon Musk surprised world financial markets by announcing his intention of taking Tesla private in order to focus on long-term strategy.Tesla also began hiring people to staff the factory on Tuesday, signaling it is confident that building work will begin soon. Fourteen positions for engineers and designers in Shanghai were advertised on Tesla's website under the moniker "Gigafactory". Most positions require more than six years of experience.John Zeng, general director of Shanghai-based consultancy LMC Automotive, told the Global Times on Wednesday that Tesla is asking for $2.5 billion to fund the first stage of the factory with an estimated yearly output of 250,000, and $5 billion in total. The fully completed factory would produce 500,000 cars per year.Zeng noted that Chinese banks are interested but are likely to ask for guarantees before making any decision on whether or not investing in Tesla's factory."Banks are not venture capitalists. Before investing, they will ask Tesla to invest its own money, or at least offer some guarantee, whether with its own shares or by some other means," he said.The fully owned local factory would allow Tesla to circumvent retaliatory tariffs China imposed on US vehicles amid the China-US trade war. Zeng noted that Tesla must work hard as it's facing increased competition in China in the following years."Tesla has a market-leading product right now, but it doesn't have much time before other automakers start producing their own high-end electric cars," Zeng said, adding that "Tesla also doesn't qualify right now for a production license in China, as it fell short of the legal requirement of 30,000 electric cars sold in the past three years. It must make a strong sales effort this year to reach that level."Tesla did not respond to requests for comment from the Global Times as of press time on Wednesday.
