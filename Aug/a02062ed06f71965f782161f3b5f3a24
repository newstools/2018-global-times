A trip by China's defense minister to India, the first since last year's Doklam standoff, was hailed by Chinese analysts on Tuesday as a landmark trip for the recovery of military ties between the two countries.At the invitation of Indian Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Wei Fenghe, also a Chinese State Councilor, will pay an official goodwill visit to India from Tuesday to Friday, according to a statement released by China's Ministry of National Defense on Monday.Wei will meet leaders of India and the Indian army, exchange views on the ties between the two countries and their militaries as well as issues of common concern, the statement said.The visit will implement the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries. A single visit cannot solve all the problems, Ye Hailin, an international relations research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday. "China-India relations are very complicated," Ye said. The two countries should build mutual trust with more dialogue and communications during Wei's visit, he said.Wei will meet Sitharaman and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India-based news website oneindia.com reported on Monday. The two sides will discuss ways of finding a permanent solution to the Doklam situation."The visit marks the comprehensive recovery of ties between China and India after the Doklam standoff last year," Qian Feng, a research fellow at the National Strategy Institute of Tsinghua University based in Beijing, told the Global Times.The establishment of a mutual military trust mechanism is likely to be an important topic at the talks, Qian noted. "There will be talks on the concrete problems the two militaries face," Qian said. "The two sides will expand cooperation and manage disputes so that the overall situation between the two countries will not be affected before the border issue is fully resolved."There may also be new progress in topics like high-level visits and joint military exercises.Both sides are willing to establish a military hotline to boost communication and avoid potential misunderstandings and tensions along the border, according to Qian. Technical issues were the most likely reason for a hotline not being established, he said. In June last year, more than 270 armed Indian troops with two bulldozers crossed the border into Doklam, China's sovereign territory, to obstruct Chinese construction of infrastructure. After a months-long military standoff, India withdrew its border personnel in August, the Xinhua News Agency reported.Newspaper headline: Defense minister to meet Indian leaders Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Look at China-Turkey ties objectivelyFair understanding of Belt and Road initiativeXi requires strengthening CPC leadership, Party building in military Antibiotic misuse becoming worldwide growing concernFirefighters gain on blazes Demonstration How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
