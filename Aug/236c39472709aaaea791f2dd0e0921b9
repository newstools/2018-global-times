More than 85 percent of Chinese people experienced a leak in personal information, according to a survey released on Wednesday amid China's rising concern over personal information security.The survey showed that harassing phone calls and text messages, phone fraud, and junk mail are what people face most after a leak. The survey was released on Wednesday by the China Consumers Association (CCA), a Beijing-based organization established in 1984, after collecting 5,458 valid responses to a questionnaire between July 17 and August 13.In the first half of 2018, complaints against the illegal collection of personal information conducted by e-commerce platforms and social media software became a new hotspot, the association said. Police in East China's Zhejiang Province recently busted the worst case of information leak, which involved three billion records of personal information hacked from telecom operators. The case affected 96 internet companies, including Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba and Jinri Toutiao, Science and Technology Daily reported Wednesday.The survey also cited respondents as saying that authorities should strengthen relevant laws and regulations as punishment for criminals and compensation for victims are not enough.China enacted the Cybersecurity Law in June 2017 to safeguard the rights of citizens, including their personal information."Since the law has not been implemented for some time, there's no consent on penalty, and the penalties on information leaks in some jurisdictions could be lighter than expected," Zhu Wei, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times on Thursday. Chinese authorities have been working on a specific legislation to protect personal information since 2011, which legal experts predicted could come as soon as 2019. Difficulty in spotting the leaker is another reason, Zhu said. A traceability system needs to be developed, which could help to identify the leaker, Zhu added.
