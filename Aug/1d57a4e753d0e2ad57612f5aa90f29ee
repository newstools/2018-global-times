Chinese hog farmers are in panic mode after the discovery of several cases of African swine fever around the country, as they face tightened government control of hog sales as part of its effort to contain the viral disease and a fresh round of price decline.Deteriorating market conditions due to the epidemic, which is hitting China for the first time, could put many Chinese hog farmers out of business. The outbreak follows an already-tough year for the once-thriving business, some farmers and analysts said on Sunday."There is panic among hog farmers," Li Yunlong, who runs a large hog farm in North China's Hebei Province, told the Global Times on Sunday. "We don't have any effective actions we can take to deal with this."As authorities moved swiftly to contain the spread of the disease, hog farmers have been banned from buying or selling pigs, according Li, adding that many farmers fear this could be the end of their businesses.Since August 16, when the first case of African swine fever was discovered in Northeast China's Liaoning Province, there have been a total of four outbreaks across the country, including major producing areas in Central China's Henan Province, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. In a statement on August 16, the ministry warned that if the African swine fever epidemic spreads further across the country, it will cause "huge" losses for the hog farming industry.Since the first case was discovered, hog prices have declined about 2.5 percent to about 13.3 yuan ($1.95) per kilogram as of Sunday, according to Feng Yonghui, chief analyst at hog market information provider soozhu.com.While the decline is not "so significant" so far, it dealt a blow to growers who had only recently seen slight jumps in hog prices, Feng said. These farmers have barely managed to start making a profit again following extremely low prices and market demand since the Chinese Spring Festival in mid-February, Feng said."This epidemic really adds to the pain of farmers, who might face even tougher times ahead," Feng told the Global Times, pointing to possible further drops in hog prices mainly due to expected decreasing market demand for pork stemming from fear of the disease.While humans are not susceptible to the disease, consumers tend to take a "cautious" stance and refrain from buying any meat once they hear "anything about an epidemic" in animals, Feng said."Supply will be driven down by disease-control measures on the production side, but demand will also decline because of consumers' lack of confidence. So the market is not so bright for farmers," according to him.Chinese hog farmers have had a tough year after prices dropped significantly following the Spring festival due to low demand and sliding prices, and some farmers have already turned to new profitable animals and crops for their farms."Hog farmers here have had a very miserable year because of excessive supply," a farmer in Wuxi, East China's Jiangsu Province, told the Global Times on Sunday. He warned that because of market oversupply, hog prices are likely to climb down.Newspaper headline: Hog farmers ‘panic’ over swine fever Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass China, US restart trade talksLook at China-Turkey ties objectivelyChina's development discourse draws applause abroad Ride hail leaves US cities short-changed in DUI revenueChinese man kidnapped: FBIDream Dance How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
