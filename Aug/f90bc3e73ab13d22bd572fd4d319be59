Earlier this month, Shanghai unveiled 100 measures that focus on opening-up in finance, industrial systems, intellectual property rights, imports and the local business environment. The municipal government also pledged to cut its administrative "red tape," according to Xinhua News Agency, including reducing the time needed to launch a new business here, in an attempt to give the city an edge in attracting more foreign talents and international investment.These are all things that foreign businesses have been urging China to implement. Had it, the city would by now be on a par with Wall Street and Silicon Valley in terms of finance and innovation. And just as it does in New York and in California, all that money and creativity would have spilled over into peripheral sectors, such as Shanghai's tertiary education system, which has been struggling to compete with renowned Western universities, and China's auto industry, which has seen rapid sales this past decade but stagnation as far as R&D of its own domestic brands.But rather than dwell on the past, let us look forward. This competitive edge is exactly what Shanghai needs to thrust itself ahead of Singapore, Seoul and Tokyo not only in terms of ingenuity, a high-income economy and rapid development, but a positive reputation, which in the international business world is arguably more important than bottom lines. Once word gets out that Shanghai is serious about not just doing short-term business with foreigners but also helping to nurture their long-term growth on this side of the world, there will be no stopping this city.Just like the song says, "I believe the children are our future, teach them well and let them lead the way." Indeed, Shanghai's future largely rests on its students, which is why it was a brilliant move by the local government to make Chinese universities more accessible to foreign students. Directly linking their graduation from local higher education institutions with the private residence permit for entrepreneurship (aka the business start-up visa) gives foreigners a fighting chance to establish a start-up business in Shanghai.The visa "is unique in that its scope of eligibility is expansive," according to china-briefing.com, including foreign students who graduated from a higher education institution in China, foreigners planning to invest in Shanghai and recent overseas graduates from top Chinese universities who have made innovative or entrepreneurial achievements. This will not only benefit academically gifted students from neighboring Belt and Road (B&R) countries and regions, but help transform the city into a strategic bridgehead to better serve the B&R.Encouraging foreign auto companies to establish research and development centers and high-end vehicle projects in Shanghai will help hasten China's own new-energy automobile sector, which this congested city needs if it ever wants to reduce its auto emissions. In July, Tesla announced that it will set up its first overseas plant in Shanghai, with a planned annual capacity of 500,000 electric cars. Xinhua reported that, with this largest-ever foreign-invested manufacturing project, Tesla became the first to benefit from a new policy that allows foreign automakers to set up wholly owned subsidiaries in China.In the first half of 2018, contracted foreign funds, an indicator of future commitments of capital, grew 18.1 percent to $21.5 billion, after Shanghai signed over 2,100 projects with overseas investors, according to South China Morning Post, citing figures recently released by the city's statistics bureau. This reverses a decline of 47 percent from a year earlier, with foreign direct investments to Shanghai increasing to $8.6 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago.As China strives to further open up its markets in honor of the 40th anniversary of the country's reform and opening-up this year, Shanghai has taken the lead in implementing relevant policies to attract foreign talents as well as foreign investments. Together, these two components will without a doubt transform Shanghai from its "has-been" status as a once-glorious international trading hub into the Asia-Pacific's new leading destination for foreign businesses.The opinions expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Global Times.
