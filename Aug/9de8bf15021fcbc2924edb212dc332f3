North China's Tianjin Municipality has unveiled a three-year plan to invest in the robotics industry amid slow economic growth, in an aim to make major breakthroughs in different types of robots and boost regional development, local news site radiotj.com reported on Sunday. The plan includes two types of service robots, one for family services such as housework and blood pressure monitoring, and the other for surgeries, the media report said. The municipality has also set its eyes on making progress in industrial robot development, including automatic welding and grinding systems for flexible high-speed railways, flying robots and underwater gliders. In 2017, Tianjin recorded an annual growth rate of 40 percent in its robot industry output, reaching 5.7 billion yuan ($837.5 million). Despite a sluggish economic growth, Tianjin has been accelerating its robotics industry development in recent years as part of the smart manufacturing integration plan for the northern Jing-Jin-Ji area. In fact, the number of robot companies in the area is already near 400, with a total output of 45 billion yuan, media reported on Wednesday. Tianjin also saw the slowest GDP growth rate of 3.4 percent in the first half of 2018 among 28 of the country's provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions that have released such performances so far. Meanwhile, its fixed-asset investment volume during that period dropped 17.3 percent, within which investment in the secondary industry dropped by about 30 percent.Newspaper headline: Slow growth in Tianjin inspires three-year robot plan Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass China, US restart trade talksLook at China-Turkey ties objectivelyChina's development discourse draws applause abroad Ride hail leaves US cities short-changed in DUI revenueChinese man kidnapped: FBIDream Dance How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
