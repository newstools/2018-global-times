A set of images featuring Chinese Muslim virtues like patriotism and integrity surfaced online during Eid al-Adha, known in China as the Corban Festival, one of Islam's most important holidays that fell this year on Wednesday. The images were designed and produced by the State-run Islamic Association of China and the Yunnan Provincial Islamic Association."These images were created for the pilgrimage this year, and also a gift to celebrate the Corban festival," Dai Junfeng, the secretary-general of the Yunnan Provincial Islamic Association, who oversaw the design, told the Global Times on Wednesday. The six images depicting the moral excellence of Chinese Muslims have been uploaded to Chinese social platforms such as Sina Weibo and WeChat for the festival. Going by the theme of patriotism, the first image cited the relevant Islamic doctrine in Chinese and showed Chinese pilgrims gathering under the Chinese national flag during their pilgrimage, and believers at the Great Mosque of Mecca praying for China's prosperity and security, the images said.The images also promote other virtues like dedication to work, integrity and amicability to each other within the Chinese Muslim community and with people from other ethnic groups. China's national flag appears three times, and the Huabiao, Chinese landmark Ornamental Pillars, is also depicted. "We are trying to make Chinese Muslims understand that Chinese Islam is deeply integrated and rooted in Chinese traditional culture, while keeping its unique characteristics," Dai noted. A set of photos of senior Chinese Muslims repairing a Chinese national flag damaged by heavy winds in Mecca, Saudi Arabia went viral in early August on Chinese social media.About 11,500 Chinese Muslims are joining the hajj this year, fewer than the 12,800 last year.Taking the pilgrimage to the holiest of all Islamic sites is one of the five tasks all Muslims are expected to do.
