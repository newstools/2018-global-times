Shi Zewu, deputy head of the association, told the Global Times on Wednesday that he has never heard about the report and refused to comment on the incident.Xuecheng could not be reached by the Global Times on Wednesday. Xuecheng posted pictures of a national flag raising ceremony on his Sina social media account on Wednesday after the scandal broke out, vowing to carry forward patriotism. The report said Xuecheng used text messages to mind-control nuns to tempt them into having sex with him, claiming it was part of their study of Buddhist doctrines.Shi Xianqi and Shi Xianjia started investigating Xuecheng's message after a nun, who stayed in Beijing in December 2017, turned to them for help with sexual messages from Xuecheng, the report said.They have consulted with experts from the Ministry of Public Security to make sure that the messages were indeed sent by Xuecheng. Shi Xianjia and Shi Xianqi also allegedly acquired a record of Xuecheng's cell phone messages "through legal means."The messages showed that Xuecheng tempted or threatened at least six nuns to have sex with him, four of whom capitulated to his requests.One of the nuns reported to a police station in Haidian district on June 29 that Xuecheng had sexually assaulted her, the report said."Longquan Temple is under his spell. Xuecheng manipulated disciples to serve his 'Buddhist Empire'… disciples under his control sacrificed their precious practices of Buddhist doctrines and violated these doctrines, even laws," read the report.The Wednesday incident is the latest sexual harassment case following reports of sexual harassment involving prominent Chinese intellectuals and activists.
