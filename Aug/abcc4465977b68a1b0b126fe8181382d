Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli has been discussing the construction of a mega project with a delegation from China State Construction Engineering Corp (CSCEC), Egyptian newspaper Ahram reported on Saturday.The two sides discussed the latest developments concerning the construction of a mega project in Egypt's New Administrative Capital on Friday, the report said.The CSCEC, China's largest construction and real estate conglomerate and biggest building work contractor, has participated in the construction of the Central Business District (CBD) in Egypt's New Administrative Capital and has long taken the lead in China's international contracting business."The CBD came at the top of the projects of mutual cooperation with the Chinese side," Madbouli said, highlighting the CSCEC's capabilities."The construction has started and I expect to see a Chinese miracle on the ground," he said. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has said that "the project will be completed in two years," Madbouli told the delegation.Sisi will sign CSCEC's official legal documents for launching the second phase of the project, the report said.Madbouli said Sisi has called on "the Chinese company to finish the project on time to put it into the Guinness World Records."Hao Peng, an official with the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, said that "China-Egypt relations are very friendly."The two sides are actively implementing the consensus reached by the two heads of state and pushing China-Africa pragmatic cooperation into a new stage, he added.The project started construction in March 2018 and is currently still under construction, he said.Upon completion, the CBD will help China-Egypt comprehensive strategic partnership reach a higher level, Peng added.Chang Weicai, CEO of the CSCEC Egypt division, told the Xinhua News Agency in July that the construction work is scheduled to be finished within three and a half years "at maximum."The project intends to offer thousands of jobs and stimulate the economy, while Egypt's government institutions are scheduled to move to the new capital within the second half of 2019. "The project reflects the depth of Egyptian-Chinese relations," said Mostafa Ibrahim, a member of the Cairo-based Egyptian Businessmen Association."China's participation in national Egyptian projects, especially the new capital, signals strong political support from Egypt," Ibrahim said, adding that more Chinese contribution to Egypt's mega projects attracts positive attention from the Egyptian people.Ibrahim foresees economic relations expanding in light of the two sides' unique historical cooperation.
