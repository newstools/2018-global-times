As China steps up efforts to crack down on counterfeit products, experts noted on Thursday that the country's campaign to protect intellectual property should yield long-term gains in ongoing trade friction with the US. Illegal activities including counterfeiting famous brands, manufacturing and selling fake and substandard products, trademark violations and false advertising are listed as priority targets for the crackdown, according to a notice released on the website of the State Administration for Market Regulation on Thursday.The notice asks local authorities to start investigating e-commerce platforms, finding upstream and downstream operators, so that the entire chain can be cracked.The campaign came amid heated discussions about Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo, which was accused of selling copycat and counterfeit goods."China is undergoing a consumption upgrade," Bai Ming, deputy director of the international market research institute at the Ministry of Commerce, told the Global Times. "Given the current complicated external environment, it's important to expand domestic demand."Fake and substandard products must be driven from the market to avoid the phenomenon of "bad money drives out good," Bai said.The US imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of imports from China for alleged theft of intellectual property including counterfeiting famous brands, Bloomberg reported.Some 25 Chinese online markets including Alibaba's Taobao and 18 physical markets were put on a US Trade Representative blacklist for allegedly selling counterfeit goods, Reuters reported."The crackdown shows that China is increasingly attaching importance to intellectual property protection," Bai said.The crackdown will also give China stronger initiatives in the trade dispute with the US, he noted.
