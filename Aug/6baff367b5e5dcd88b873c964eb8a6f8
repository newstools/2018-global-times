Chinese collectors are lapping up commemorative banknotes for Karl Marx, with over 25,000 reportedly sold.A local tourism company in Marx's hometown of Trier, Germany confirmed that a zero-euro note with an image of the philosopher on it has been a best seller, cankaoxiaoxi.com reported on Tuesday, citing German media Deutsche Welle.More than 100,000 notes have been sold out, Hans-Albert Becker, Trier's tourism and marketing representative, was quoted as saying in the report. The bills feature a purple hue with a watermark and serial number, and have proven particularly popular in China with at least 25,000 to 30,000 bought by Chinese, Becker noted.The souvenir bills are seen as a commercial opportunity by some, as Chinese people consider Marx a renowned thinker. On Taobao, one of China's biggest online shopping platforms, many stores have begun selling the banknotes from 40 yuan ($6) to 200 yuan each, with the original price being 3 euro ($3.40).A Taobao vendor, who sells each note for 99 yuan, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the bills are quite popular among collectors."I have already sold about 200 of them. A collector bought 100 notes with consecutive serial numbers," the vendor said, noting bills with consecutive serial numbers are much more expensive, but he declined to disclose the price.Another Taobao seller who has sold dozens told the Global Times that Marx's 200th birth anniversary fueled the souvenir's popularity."Some buyers are fond of Marx. Buying the souvenir allowed them to engage in the commemoration," the seller said."My inventory is at low level now," the seller said.May 5, 2018 marked the 200th anniversary of Marx's birth with commemorative activities in China. A three-month exhibit of Marx held at the National Museum of China, which ended on August 5, received more than two million visitors, according to the Xinhua News Agency.Newspaper headline: 25k souvenir banknotes of Karl Marx sold to collectors Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Protecting peace, stability is top of human rights agenda for XinjiangWhy Washington stabs Turkey in the backScientists create lightweight, fire-retardant artificial wood Streaming media trades connectivity for convenienceCellist kicked off AA flight First Ladies' fashions How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
