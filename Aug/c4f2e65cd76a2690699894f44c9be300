The 142-gigabyte data is separated into three parts, involving 263 million records and 130 million people, The Beijing News reported.Intelligence experts at Zpower, a company committed to fight cybercrime, said that the data could have been hacked 20 days ago when Huazhu programmers uploaded the information to GitHub, a service that allows engineers to collaborate on developing software coding, The Beijing News report added.Zpower experts claimed they have confirmed the data's authenticity.Xin Haiguang, a senior IT commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday that authorities should take more steps to protect information security.The lack of legislation and law enforcement has spawned the growth of the private information sales industry and prevented people from effectively safeguarding their legal rights, Xin noted. "As the public becomes increasing concerned about information security, the country's legislators should soon come up with enhanced legal protection," Xin said.
