Three men in their late 20s were shot on Tuesday in Mattapan, Boston. One of them was killed and two others were wounded, Boston police said. The shooting occurred around 9:48 a.m. local time, police said. The two wounded were not believed to be life-threatening, according to a report of The Boston Globe. Boston Police Commissioner William Gross told the media that the three victims were in a motor vehicle when being shot. "At this time, it doesn't appear to be random," Gross said, asking the public to cooperate with police investigations. The cold hard fact is that there are too many guns on the street, he said.
