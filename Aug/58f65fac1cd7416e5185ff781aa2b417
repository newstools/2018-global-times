The world's highest 500-kilovolt transformer substation has begun to provide electricity to Tibet, with experts predicting the Southwest China region can supply other provinces in the future.The 500-kilovolt substation in Markam county went operational Saturday, according to a statement released Tuesday by the State Grid Corporation of China on its official website.The grid upgrade from 220 to 500 kilovolts will guarantee more stable electricity, said Han Xiaoping, chief analyst at energy industry website china5e.com on Tuesday."In the past, energy supply in Tibet was relatively insufficient," Han told the Global Times. "People sometimes needed to transport fuel to Tibet to ensure usage. But with better power grids, the problem will be solved."Built at an altitude of 4,300 meters, the Markam substation is "the highest 500-kilovolt transformer substation in the world," according to the statement.Construction took "more than 700 days," the statement said. Workers had to cope with the high altitude, low temperatures, lack of oxygen and intense ultraviolet rays. The Markam substation is a part of the Central Tibet Grid Interconnection Project, which aims to meet the electricity needs of central Tibet and promote development.When it is completed, the project will break world records. It is not only the world's highest power grid with an average altitude of 4,000 meters, but also has the biggest altitude difference of 3,100 meters, Tibet-based news website xzxw.com reported."Tibet doesn't need too much electricity itself, but it has huge potential for generating hydroelectricity," Han said."In the future, the project will allow Tibet to output extra electricity to other Chinese provinces, which could help with economic development in Tibet."
