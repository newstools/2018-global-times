China and South Korea could work together in promoting regional economic development, especially denuclearization of the peninsula, scholars from China and South Korea said on Tuesday.Scholars from the two countries engaged in a dialogue jointly held on Wednesday by the Global Times and the Sejong Institute and Center for North and South Korea Studies of Yanbian University in Yanji in Northeast China's Jilin Province.Scholars agreed China and South Korea share great interest in solving regional issues, promoting globalization amid rising protectionism and addressing denuclearization.Lee Seong-hyon, director of the Center for Chinese Studies, said during the dialogue that China and South Korea could work together in building an economic community by connecting the railway work. He noted that the South Korean President Moon Jae-in government is proposing to build a railway network in Northeast Asia to connect South Korea, North Korea and China's northeast regions with Europe."China and South Korea would be affected amid the anti-globalization trend which started in the US," said Mei Ninghua, head of the Beijing journalist association. "South Korea would suffer more since it is an ally of the US."Despite different views on China's and South Korea's roles in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, scholars from the two sides agreed more cooperation should be launched to persuade North Korea and the US to stick to denuclearization.Zheng Jiyong, director of the Center for Korean Studies of Fudan University, said during the dialogue that the Korean Peninsula denuclearization issue had "entered a crucial period and this may be the last chance to solve it. China and South Korea should work together on promoting the denuclearization process."It would be of great help if South Korea could persuade the US in realizing its promise on safety guarantee to North Korea."North Korea has made efforts at denuclearization which required the US to make reciprocal actions to promote the peace process, Zheng concluded.Some Chinese scholars noted the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) was an unavoidable problem.Lü Chao, a research fellow at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that THAAD is an important obstacle between China and South Korea, and without solving it, future development of China-South Korea ties might be affected. "The deployment of THAAD was an abnormal decision made by the Park administration," Zheng said. "And it is time to solve the problem since Park Geun-hye has been put in jail."
