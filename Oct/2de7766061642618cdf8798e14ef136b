After a series of tests, they will work with 14 other BeiDou-3 satellites currently in orbit.BeiDou-3 satellites have been frequently launched since July, with two satellites being sent every month. Eight BeiDou-3 satellites have already entered orbit within four months. Ma Jiaqing, deputy director of the China Satellite Navigation Office, said that they plan to send three more satellites into orbit by the end of the year, which will lead to the formation of the basic BeiDou-3 system capable of providing services to countries along the Belt and Road initiative route.The BeiDou-3 system is expected to provide services to the world by 2020 and become a comprehensive positioning, navigation and time service system by 2035, Ma said.The BeiDou navigation system has already seen wide use in public security, transportation and disaster control. It is also playing an important role in the building of smart cities and social governance.With the BeiDou navigation system's help, the number of serious traffic accidents and related incidents dropped more than 50 percent in 2017.The BeiDou navigation system is also being installed in smartphones in the Chinese market, with most mainstream smartphones in the world already supporting the system.Key components in the BeiDou navigation system are domestically made, Ma said, noting the importance of independence and control over the technology.Newspaper headline: Nation launches two more BeiDou-3 satellites for system Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass China's restraint can prevent Cold WarAs US closes up, EU and China must build closer tiesSaudi Arabia vows retaliation over potential sanctions LAFAA attendees share thoughts on Chinese investments Chinese PE teachers visit US to bolster sports educationRose Princesses How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
