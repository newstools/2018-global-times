Most of the companies investing in Urumqi are specializing in manufacturing, new energy and new material industries, the report said."Xinjiang will play its economic radiation effect better in Central Asia along with the development of the Belt and Road initiative," Wang Dehua, head of the Institute for South and Central Asian Studies at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday. "It is the good and efficient business environment in Xinjiang that has enhanced our confidence and determination in investing in the region," Wang Wenyin, board chairman of the Shenzhen-based Amer International Group, was quoted as saying by the daily newspaper. The company has invested in an industrial park under the framework of the Belt and Road initiative and construction of the park started on September 30 in the Urumqi Economic and Technological Development Zone (Toutunhe District).Stable society "It was the support from local governments and residents that made it possible for us to set up factories in Xinjiang," a director assistant surnamed Yuan from a shoe factory based in South China's Guangdong Province, told the Global Times. Yuan said that it was a mutually beneficial action as they could reduce production costs while helping local residents find a direction for their life, preventing them from straying toward extremism."To attract investment is to expand the scale of opening-up and thus to promote the economy of Xinjiang," La Disheng, a professor at the Party School of the Communist Party of China Xinjiang regional committee, told the Global Times on Sunday.La stressed that a stable society is the prerequisite for economic development.Wang Dehua echoed La, saying that "education is a fundamental measure to solve the problem as it prevents people from being deceived by extremism and provides them with the abilities to pursue a better life." The Global Times learned from company owners who invested in Xinjiang that women were once forbidden from working, when the region was heavily haunted by extremism in the past few years. They said some of the local women were beaten by their husbands after getting home from work, but now the situation has changed.
