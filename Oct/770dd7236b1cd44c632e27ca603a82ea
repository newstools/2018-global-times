China will play a bigger and more constructive role in the region especially to help create a more stable trade and investment environment in the surroundings, Li noted. According to data from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, the bilateral trade volume between China and Palestine reached $69.28 million in 2017, a 16.2 percent year-on-year growth.The feasibility research on free trade between the two sides was launched in November 2017 and broad consensus was reached.
