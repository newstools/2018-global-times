A Chinese university said on Thursday that it has begun an investigation into fraud allegations against one of its professors, who has allegedly pulled out over 100 papers from online databases as the scandal lit up the internet. Liang Ying, a 39-year-old professor at Nanjing University's School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, withdrew over 100 of her online papers and admitted to academic misconduct, China Youth Daily reported on Wednesday.The report said she plagiarized at least 15 of her papers. One of her papers published in 2002 was a shorter version of another paper published in 2001 by a Xiamen University professor.Liang later explained to China Youth Daily that these papers were published before 2005, a time when she claims she did not understand academic criterion.Nanjing University has already put together a group to look into the case, an administration office employee told Global Times on Thursday on the condition of anonymity."Our university has always adopted a zero-tolerance policy on academic fraud," she said. She also noted that the university will take action in accordance with the regulations of both the Ministry of Education and Nanjing University.Liang was selected to a youth program under the Changjiang Scholar Program in 2015, set up by the Ministry of Education to attract outstanding scholars in China.Academic fraud cases are prevalent in this field because the current evaluation mechanism only places importance on the number of papers, Zhu Lijia, a professor of public management at the Chinese Academy of Governance in Beijing, told the Global Times on Thursday.Zhu noted that the Chinese academe needs to step forward on transparency, democratization and standardization.An oversea academic website removed 11 papers of a student at Tsinghua University's Shenzhen graduate school because of academic misconduct, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday.It reported that the university latter stripped the student of his doctorate, stressing that the university never tolerates academic fraud.Newspaper headline: University probes scholar who pulls out 100 papers Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Scholars decode future of China-US relationsWelcome AbeExperts recommend stopping illegal climbing on the Great Wall, opening up wild sections Weddings no longer about heart – it costs an arm and a legCalifornia's shadow looms over Nevada's midtermGiant balloon How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
