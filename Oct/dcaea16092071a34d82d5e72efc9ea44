The meeting will continue to focus on dispute management, joint search and rescue operations and other topics of mutual concern, Chen said.Lu said that China believes the meeting will boost the development of ties between China and the Philippines, and contribute to peace and stability in the South China Sea.In early August, China and the ASEAN agreed on a draft text of the Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea during the China-ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting in Singapore.If China and the Philippines agree on some areas, they will serve as the basis for negotiations with other ASEAN members, Chen said.The BCM was signed in 2017 to resolve maritime issues through talks and negotiations, Lu said, noting that the platform has also contributed to dispute management.
