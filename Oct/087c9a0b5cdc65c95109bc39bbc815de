The gliders reached a depth of 7,076 meters in the Mariana Trench, Xinhua reported.The gliders continued to operate normally even when super typhoons Mangkhut and Kong-rey hit the area, and have collected valuable data as the typhoons passed over when all other scientific work had to be suspended, Yu said.The gliders were also used in the Bering Sea area in July for the first time in an arctic expedition to measure the ocean's temperature, salinity and depth.The team also conducted terrain detection at a 5,000-meter-deep seabed, and studied samples collected from sea floor sediments, which provide the basis for sea trial site selection of a manned underwater vehicle, Xinhua reported."It will be a breakthrough once the vehicle comes into use, which can help obtain first-hand hydrological data and largely increase the accuracy of hydrological investigations," Hu Zhiyong, chairman of the China Maritime Research Union, told the Global Times on Thursday.The data can provide accurate information about ocean traffic, and can be used to predict ocean disasters and tides, Hu said. The marine lander named Haijiao stayed in the trench and operated for 26 days, breaking a world record for one-time working hours in a dark environment, Xinhua reported.The team also found a type of fish of Bassozetus at a depth of 7,012 meters, the deepest water area known to humans where such fish can survive.
