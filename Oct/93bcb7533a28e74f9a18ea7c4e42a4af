China's export rebate rate for some goods will be raised to 16 percent from the current levels of 15 percent and 13 percent effective November 1, China National Radio reported on Monday, citing a meeting of the State Council, the country's cabinet. Tax authorities will also simplify the taxation system by reducing the export rebate rate from seven levels to five levels while also shortening tax refund times and promoting digital applications for tax refunds, the report said.Bai Ming, deputy director of the Ministry of Commerce's International Market Research Institute, told the Global Times on Monday that the export rebate rate hike, which is in line with WTO rules, is to "encourage and support Chinese companies' export, protect their fair competition in overseas market" so as to help Chinese enterprises dilute the negative effect of US trade policies. China has vowed in recent months to roll out policies that could stabilize China's foreign trade and promote the sound and sustainable development of domestic economy. In addition to export rebate rate increases, China is also studying other policies that are in tandem with international rules, such as full refunds of value-added tax of some export commodities and expanding the use of export credit insurance to reduce trade risks, China International Trade Representative and Vice Minister of Commerce Fu Ziying said in a press conference of the State Council on September 25. Bai also suggested that Chinese government could facilitate trade connectivity with countries and regions along the Belt and Road initiative and set up more free trade zones to stimulate the country's foreign trade development. In the first eight months of 2018, China's trade volume surged 16.1 percent year-on-year to $3.02 trillion, according to customs data. The rise in China's foreign trade came despite the US kicking off a new round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, which took effect on September 24. Also on September 7, China announced that it will raise the export tax rebates for products such as mechanical and electrical goods as well as cultural products.Tax rebate rates for multicomponent integrated circuits, non-electromagnetic interference filters, books, and newspapers will be increased to 16 percent, the Ministry of Finance said on its website.Newspaper headline: Nation to raise export rebate rate of some goods to 16% amid trade war Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Pentagon paper reveals strategy beyond US midterm electionsDealing with US requires unique wisdomFlag-raising ceremony held at Tian'anmen Square to celebrate National Day UA pilots under fire for napping during trans-Atlantic flightExpansion work on Garden of Flowing Fragrance to beginChina's climate change efforts highlighted in CA How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
