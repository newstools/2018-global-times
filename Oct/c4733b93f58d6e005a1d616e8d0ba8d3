It can also carry 50 survivors or payloads of the same weight, the Global Times learned.Being able to cover all of the South China Sea, the AG600 could also join military operations, said military experts.It can also gather 12 tons of water either from its land base or directly from water surfaces before being deployed for firefighting missions, greatly expanding China's capability in fighting forest fires.The AG600 is the third member of China's large aircraft family after the transport aircraft Y-20 made its maiden flight in 2013 and the passenger aircraft C919 made its maiden flight in 2017.AVIC said it is aiming to deliver the AG600 by 2022, the Xinhua News Agency reported in May.
