A Chinese tourist agency is putting on a deluxe tour in November to Panmunjom's military facilities that hitherto could not be visited, after the two Koreas entered into discussions over disarming the Joint Security Area (JSA) at the truce village.  "It will probably cost more than 10,000 yuan ($1,443) per person, including flights, visa, insurance, board and lodging," said a travel consultant who asked to be identified as Anson from LE Travel, a premium travel agency based in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong Province, on Sunday  "After the disarmament [of the JSA], more military facilities and zones at Panmunjom will probably be open to visitors. We can even possibly cross the Military Demarcation Line to visit some facilities on the South Korean side," Anson told the Global Times. Visitors to Panmunjom have to stay under strict military supervision throughout their journey, said Anson.  LE Travel is still discussing the details with local agencies and will release an itinerary next week, Anson said.  South and North Korea had completed demining operations in the JSA, and are expected to continue to pull out guard posts, troops and other weapons from the area from next week till the end of October, the Korean Broadcasting System reported Friday. The two Koreas will each send 35 unarmed police officers to guard the JSA after the disarmament process is completed. The area will be open to residents from both sides and tourists from 9am to 5pm.
