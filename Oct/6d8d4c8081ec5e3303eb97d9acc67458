"The density of water is about 800 times the density of air, but the aircraft has to reach the same speed to take off on land and water, so the drag reduction function must be well-designed," he told the Global Times.Huang added that water splash must be controlled as well to avoid damage to the engine and propellers.Codenamed "Kunlong" and designed to be the world's largest amphibious aircraft, the AG600 will be mainly used for maritime rescue, fighting forest fires and marine monitoring. The AG600 can reach further distances and travel faster than helicopters and other vessels, and is capable of covering more than 4,000 kilometers in a rescue mission. It can also carry 50 survivors or payloads of the same weight and take off with waves up to two meters in height. Being able to cover all of the South China Sea, the AG600 could also join military operations, said military experts.It can also take in 12 tons of water either from its land base or directly from water surface before being deployed for firefighting missions, greatly expanding China's capability to fight forest fires.The AG600 is the third member of China's large aircraft family after the transport aircraft Y-20 made its maiden flight in 2013.Also, the passenger aircraft C919 made its maiden flight in 2017.
