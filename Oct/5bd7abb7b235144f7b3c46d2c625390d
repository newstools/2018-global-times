He Weiwen, a former Chinese trade official, said the move to request a panel of experts is a "natural" step that is in line with DSB procedures because bilateral consultations between the countries and the US have failed."The move itself is very normal. It's just following procedures," He, who is now a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday. "But it is significant when seven major economies, including allies, are challenging you at the same time."At the meeting, the EU said the fact that one country was targeted by seven complaints in one day was "unprecedented" and "a sign of the degree of objection the US actions were eliciting from members," according to the DSB document. China also said that the "tariffs, taken under the guise of national security, are obviously and egregiously inconsistent" with WTO rules.The US rejected the requests for setting up a panel and argued that "it is simply not the role of the WTO to review a sovereign nation's judgment of its essential security interests." The US further warned that such a step by the DSB would undermine its legitimacy and "even the viability of the WTO."Lasting damageBut Chinese analysts said that it is the US' reputation and standing at the WTO that is most at risk, not the legitimacy of the WTO."No doubt, the US has been one of the most powerful voices, if not the most powerful, in the WTO and it has benefited greatly from its influence… But increasingly, the US is showing a pattern where it does not follow WTO rules when they don't serve its interests," said Bai Ming, deputy director of the Ministry of Commerce's International Market Research Institute.Bai told the Global Times on Wednesday that although reforms in certain areas are required, the WTO will remain important, despite talk in the US about the diminished role of the multilateral body. He also said it will be hard for the US to maintain its strong voice in a body that it disrespects.Trade officials from 13 WTO members, including the EU, Australia, Japan and South Korea, convened a meeting last week in Canada to focus on WTO reforms.  In a joint communiqué, the trade officials took apparent aim at the US, saying "we are deeply concerned by recent developments in international trade, particularly the rise in protectionism, which negatively affect the WTO and put the entire multilateral trading system at risk.""For [the US administration], this might be just about winning short-term gains and winning votes in elections, but the broader implications will last," He said.Newspaper headline: US under pressure at WTO Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass China-Belgium cooperation to bring geothermal boostChina won't seek to control global rare-earth market by cutting outputCambridge scholar lauds reform and opening-up while underscoring West's ignorance of nation Weddings no longer about heart – it costs an arm and a legCalifornia's shadow looms over Nevada's midtermGiant balloon How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
