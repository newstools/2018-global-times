"It's all about our belief and life," she noted.Besides the dancing program, Li said that believers had also planned to perform kuaiban, a traditional Chinese folk-art form whereby stories are recited to the rhythm of bamboo clappers, but instead, they picked stories from the Bible as the content. Users on Sina Weibo, also posted videos and photos showing Christians performing worship songs with local operas in  Henan and Shandong Province.To ensure a sound environment for Christmas, local authorities such as those in Beijing and Ningbo, Zhejiang Province also rolled out measures to eliminate safety hazards.
