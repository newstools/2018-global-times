The meeting is the outcome of the informal meeting."People-to-people visits aim to make two peoples view each other in a more positive way, and it's also very helpful to push forward bilateral relationship," Zhang Jiadong, professor at the Center for American Studies, Fudan University, told the Global Times on Friday. Zhang noted that the two sides still have a lot of potential to boost people-to-people and cultural exchanges. "Our expectation for the Chinese outbound market is very small. We saw just 250,000 [visitors] in 2017. We want this to become 1.4 million by 2019," said Satyajeet Rajan, director general of India tourism, in September. Moreover, Indian movies such as Dangal, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, and Toilet: have been very popular among Chinese audience. Dangal grossed 1.3 billion yuan ($189 million) in China alone, more than 60 percent of its global revenue.Chinese Ambassador to India, Luo Zhaohui, told Indian media The Tribune in October that the bilateral relations have entered the fast lane.He said one of the outcomes of the informal meeting is that two countries carried out "China-India Plus" cooperation in Afghanistan. The two sides jointly conducted a training program for Afghan diplomats.However, Zhang warned of many uncertainties ahead. "The upcoming India general election next year will have an impact on Sino-Indian relations and it is the major reason why India wants to maintain stable diplomatic ties with China."He said that New Delhi hopes Chinese leaders will visit India before the election to help keep peace on the border, which will win points for the ruling party.
