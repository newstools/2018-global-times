 A Chinese underground bishop in Shantou diocese will retire and replaced by a government-approved cleric, sources told the Global Times on Tuesday. 
Chinese bishop Huang Bingzhang on Tuesday vowed to earnestly fulfill his duties as the diocesan bishop of Shantou, South China's Guangdong Province after he received a mandate. 
The mandate was issued on December 7 and delivered to Huang last week at a meeting between a visiting Vatican delegation and several Chinese bishops. 
The 88-year-old underground bishop Zhuang Jianjian will retire, a source from China's religious sector confirmed with the Global Times on Tuesday. 
"The mission now is to unite Catholics in the diocese and reduce divergence so as to achieve the common goal of better serving church members," Huang told the Global Times on Tuesday.
The appointment follows a historic bishop appointment agreement between China and the Vatican in September and last week's rare visit by a Vatican delegation amid warming relations. 
Bishop Zhan Silu, another government-approved cleric, will be diocesan bishop of Mindong, Southeast China's Fujian Province.
Guo Xijin, the underground bishop of the diocese of Mindong, has accepted the role of auxiliary bishop.
