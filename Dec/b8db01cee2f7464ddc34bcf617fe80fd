During his six-day stay in China, Steinmeier will also hold talks in Beijing on the societal and social challenges of digital transformation posed by artificial intelligence and big data, and on e-governance, his office said."Germany has been intensifying digital transformation in recent years. The German president very likely wants to seek greater cooperation with China in the digital area due to the latter's improvements in fields like big data and cloud computing," Liu Bin, director of the Institute of World Economy of the Dalian Maritime University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Liu continued to stress that because the US has hiked tariffs on imported passenger cars from the European Union, Germany is also possible to increase investments in the automobile manufacturing China. "The two sides may also seek cooperation in 5G technology," Liu said.
