Myanmar has moved swiftly to accelerate the implementation of projects and cooperation with China under the Belt and Road initiative (BRI), marking a shift in the Southeast Asian country's past hesitation toward the China-proposed initiative and highlighting the BRI's long-term benefits for countries along the route.In a major step to ensure fast progress, Myanmar formed a high-level steering committee for implementation of BRI projects, including the establishment of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) and China-Myanmar border economic cooperation zone, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday.The committee is chaired by Myanmese State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, according to Xinhua. Myanmar's Vice-President U Myint Swe serves as vice chairman and other ministers and regional chief ministers are the members, the report said."This shows that Myanmar, which was somewhat reluctant toward the BRI, has realized the long-term benefits of the initiative for its domestic economic development and has decided to speed up the implementation process," Zhao Jianglin, an expert on Southeast Asian affairs at the National Institute of International Strategy under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.Zhao noted that the committee will help speed up the implementation of various projects under the BRI, "some of which have been slow to realize" because of "Myanmar's reluctance and other domestic factors."Prior to the establishment of the committee, Myanmar officials also vowed to speed up the implementation of BRI projects in the country. During a visit to Myanmar by Ning Jizhe, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, China's economic planner, the two sides discussed specifics regarding the CMEC and other key projects such as New Yangon city projects, Xinhua reported on November 27.In a separate move, China and Myanmar signed a framework agreement in early November to move forward on a multi-billion dollar deep sea port project in Kyaukpyu, a strategic town along the coast of the Bay of Bengal. Negotiations for the project had been stalled due to financing and other issues."Myanmar's increasing efforts to speed up the implementation of BRI cooperation signals a positive trend that countries, which have been reluctant or even critical of the BRI, would eventually realize the win-win nature of the initiative and come around at the end," she added.She noted that some of the criticism toward the BRI related to debt issues is sheer exaggeration by countries weary of China's growing influence but said that "the benefits of the BRI cannot be ignored by some of these countries which face daunting economic issues at home."To ensure the BRI will bring even more benefits to the participating countries, China should also make certain adjustments, including setting up training programs for local workers so they can be hired by projects.Newspaper headline: Myanmar revs up BRI projects Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Digital transformation tops Steinmeier's first state tripBlind anger won't help France out of economic woesChina-US trade deal needs mutual actions On-demand streaming changing our habitsChildren return to schoolLA Auto Show How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
