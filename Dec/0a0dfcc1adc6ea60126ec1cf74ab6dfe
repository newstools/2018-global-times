Northwest China's Shaanxi became the second province in China to abolish its halal food identification standard, after Gansu Province, in a bid to fight what authorities call the "pan-halal tendency" and curb religious extremism. Shaanxi Administration for Market Regulation announced Tuesday that it has removed its halal food identification standard in line with requirements of the country's Standardization Law.Gansu Province abolished four local halal-related identification standards on food, restaurants, dairy and noodle enterprises, which as an official at the Gansu Ethnic Affair Commission told the Global Times it aims to better protect rights of minorities. Other provinces, regions and municipalities including Ningxia, Qinghai, Henan and Tianjin will also abolish their halal identification standards, the official previously told the Global Times. Although the identification standards have been abolished, halal food produced by qualified halal producing companies should still have halal labels, the official said. In 2015, eight provinces, regions and municipalities agreed to promote unified halal food identification standards, aiming to introduce China-made halal food to the market, according to a 2015 Xinhua News Agency report.China is home to more than 22 million Muslims. The halal industry has been increasing at a rate of 20 percent every year, Xinhua said.
