The century-old Xujiahui cathedral, one of Shanghai's iconic buildings, reopens to the public in December 2017 after a two-year renovation. Photo: ICGuo Xijin, the underground bishop of the diocese of Mindong in Fujian Province, southeastern China, has accepted the role of auxiliary bishop to make way for bishop Zhan Silu from the State-sanctioned church."I will become the auxiliary bishop, and bishop Zhan Silu will be the diocesan bishop in Mindong," Guo told the Global Times.  This happened after Guo and Zhan met with a Vatican delegation to Beijing this week, headed by Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli, Guo said.The underground and State-sanctioned churches in the diocese of Mindong in Fujian Province will merge following the handover, Guo said.Asked how well he thinks the underground church will accept the change, he said, "There's nothing to worry about, as this is God's will."This is the first resolution to the status of underground bishops following the signing of a provisional agreement between China and the Holy See on the appointment of bishops in September. The agreement aims to resolve the split between the State-sanctioned Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association and the underground church which swears allegiance to the Pope. Zhan, vice chairman of the Bishops' Conference of the Catholic Church in China, is one of seven State-appointed bishops ordained without papal approval, but was recognized by the Pope in September as part of the provisional agreement, according to the Vatican's press office.Zhan could not be reached for comment.The Vatican first demanded Guo step down in December 2017.Guo said he is yet to be notified how and when the official handover will happen, and whether he will be issued a bishop license by the Chinese government following the handover. "My main duty now is still pastoral work, but I will discuss with bishop Zhan about management of the diocese," he said. Wang Meixiu, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said "This signals the underground church will gradually become history, and underground and State-sanctioned bishops will be in communion with each other and with the Holy See.""Of course it will take time for the underground church to accept this change of bishop. However such a change follows church rules and is in line with the interest of the Catholic Church and the Chinese government," she told the Global Times.
