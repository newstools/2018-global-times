While the US has resorted to various means to target Chinese tech giant Huawei, China will beat back any efforts to contain its technological advancement by furthering opening-up and cooperation.On Monday, representatives from China and South Korea held discussions on such issues as 5G, big data, artificial intelligence, network security and the industrial internet and reached a broad consensus during the 4th Korea-China Information and Communication Technology Partnership Ministerial Strategic Dialogue held in Seoul. Both sides also determined their cooperation priorities for the next stage during the meeting, the People's Post and Telecommunications News reported on Tuesday.There hasn't been much media coverage of this meeting, but it shows that China will not stop seeking cooperation with the outside world in terms of technology development.The arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou has put the Chinese telecommunication equipment provider under unprecedented pressure from the US government. Yet, despite the US targeting of Huawei, the company recently issued an official letter to its global supply partners, stating that "we will not change our partnership with global supply chain partners because of the unreasonableness of the US government."Huawei has been at the forefront of developing the 5G network, which has just completed a standalone functional and performance test of 5G LampSite, according to the company's official website. To a certain extent, Huawei's success and technological progress cannot exist without its extensive cooperation with more than 13,000 supply partners as well as with industrial peers, which is why the company adheres to the principle of openness and cooperation under any circumstances.Huawei is one of the few Chinese tech giants that have advanced technology competitiveness in the global arena, and it is also the only one whose 5G technology is comparable with Western rivals. So the US pressure on Huawei through Meng's arrest is not intended just to obtain a bargaining chip for its later trade talks with China. Fundamentally speaking, the attack on Huawei is to keep down China's technological advancement so as to contain its rise in terms of its economic prowess.Despite such pressure, China should not stop cooperation with the outside world. Further expansion of opening-up and cooperation is the only way out for China to break through the US-led technology containment.Only through opening-up and cooperation can China show its technological progress and advantages to the world so as to gain a foothold in the international market. In the meantime, various countries can make full use of their comparative advantages and optimize the global value chain through cooperation, eventually promoting the development of global industries.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass If Canada wants to fool China with its judicial independence excuse in Huawei CFO case, it's gravely mistakenWashington's move to stifle Huawei will undermine itselfTop engineer discloses how China deals with foreign intelligence-backed cyber attacks On-demand streaming changing our habitsChildren return to schoolLA Auto Show How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
