I hope that our new company can surpass it," Lai Zhiyong, an employee at AVIC (Chengdu) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System Co Ltd, said in a video posted with the statement.At the same event on Tuesday, AVIC announced the 100th Wing Loong series armed reconnaissance drone for export has passed inspection and will be delivered to its client.This is a new record number for Chinese drone export, reads a separate statement AVIC released on Tuesday.Li said that the reason behind the success of the Chinese drone on the international market is its high quality and pricing, as China continues to make rapid progress in related technologies.Countries like Egypt, Indonesia and Serbia are operating the Wing Loong I drone, Jane's Defence Weekly reported.Wing Loong I-D, a new entry to the Wing Loong series that uses an all composite material structure, made its maiden flight on Sunday.Newspaper headline: 100th Wing Loong ready for delivery Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Nepal expects more Chinese investment in infrastructure to boost developmentChina's new generator unit to power all-electric warshipsWhich country is set to lead on 5G development?
