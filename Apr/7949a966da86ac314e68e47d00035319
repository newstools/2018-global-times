E-commerce giant Jingdong vowed to strengthen internal management on Tuesday after being warned by government authorities for selling illegal publications online.Five regulators including Beijing's cyberspace and public security authorities held talks with Jingdong on Monday about selling illegal products, publications and other printed materials online.Jingdong had failed to regulate products and so caused a negative social impact, they said.Jingdong, or JD.com Inc, was also ordered by authorities to "inspect and clean" illegal content on its site, the  Beijing Business Today reported.  Jingdong said in a statement sent to the Global Times that it would improve its censorship team and conduct a thorough internal examination to enhance its management and censorship responsibilities. The statement did not specify the illegal publications and a staffer at the company refused to confirm or elaborate when contacted by the Global Times. Christian groups complained on Chinese social media that Bibles were no longer available on Jingdong.A search for "Bible" in Chinese on the Jingdong website and app yielded no results, but changing the keyword into English produced a long list of Bible-related products. Bible-related books and products remained available on Jingdong rival Taobao and at online book retailer Dangdang. Grand Theft Auto V, which was accused by Web users for its violent content, remained available on Jingdong. The game was pulled off shelves in 2014 by retailers Target and Kmart in Australia for scenes of violence against women.
