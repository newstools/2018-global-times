Chinese fund managers had one of their best years in 2017 as profits skyrocketed, according to a report released on Saturday. Experts said a stable stock market, particularly gains in blue-chip stocks, contributed hugely to the surge in profits for fund managers.However, the burgeoning industry might face setbacks this year - even though the fund market continues to mature - as stock market volatility and stricter financial regulations are expected, experts noted.In 2017, the top 10 fund managers in China pulled in a staggering 285.39 billion yuan ($45.5 billion) in total profits, according to the report from asset management industry information provider jnlc.com, co-founded by the Xinhua News Agency and the China Securities Journal.Profits for the top 10 fund managers in 2017 were in stark contrast to a 46.19 billion yuan loss in 2016, the report showed. Tianhong Asset Management Co was the top earner in 2017, with a profit of 57.1 billion yuan, it said. Some of the country's largest funds turned huge losses in 2016 into profits in 2017. E Fund Management Co, which lost 20.04 billion yuan in 2016, made 38.94 billion yuan in 2017, placing it right behind Tianhong as the second-largest earner."More than anything else, the robust year for the fund industry was because of the stable financial market in 2017," Dong Dengxin, director of the Financial Securities Institute at Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Sunday. "We should remember in 2016 the market experienced great turbulence."Blue chip gainsDong noted that the gains made in blue chip stocks might have also contributed largely to the success in 2017. "The bet on blue chip stocks turned out to be very successful for these fund managers," he said.According to the jnlc.com report, equity funds generated 69.32 billion yuan in profits for managers in 2017 and balanced funds, which also bet heavily on stocks, saw 209.65 billion yuan in profits. Most funds invested in blue chip stocks, such as insurance firm Ping An and Chinese liquor maker Wuliangye Yibin Co, which attracted 86.55 billion yuan and 54.85 billion yuan in investment, up 101.46 percent and 136.47 percent year-on-year. "The bull run by blue chips last year really helped," an asset management industry insider told the Global Times on Sunday. The insider spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press."The amount of money poured into funds was just incredible," the insider said, adding that investors appear to be more rational and confident about the market and fund managers. "Volume is the key for fund managers to generate a profit. We have never seen anything like this before."At the end of 2017, Chinese private fund assets hit a record 11.63 trillion yuan, increasing 26.85 percent from a year earlier, according to a report from financial data provider Wind on January 20. The report noted that as internet services expanded rapidly in China, more money was guided toward online wealth management and money market management products rather than toward bank savings.Dong said that fund managers tend to focus on long-term investment and making stable gains, which is why they are attractive to a growing number of Chinese investors, who seek stable earnings.However, fund managers might be headed for a rocky year ahead because of tightening regulations that would curb the massive money market funds and also because of potential voracious volatilities in the stock market this year, experts noted."Market regulations like the crackdown on peer-to-peer lending platforms could certainly have a negative impact on volume," the fund industry insider said.Dong added that "there are a few unstable factors for the A-Share market this year," such as expected turbulence on Wall Street given various political and economic reasons. "That could weigh on the prospects of fund managers this year," he said.Newspaper headline: Fund managers post stellar profits Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Russian diplomat expulsions signal crude side of Western intentionChina prepares aircraft carrier for sea trialXi Jinping, Kim Jong Un hold talks in Beijing Remembering the 'Flying Tigers' eight decades laterSafety doubts leave self-driving cars facing uphill battle for public trustConcern as identity theft grows How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
