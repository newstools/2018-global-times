Photo: ICChina will further open up its massive automobile industry to foreign carmakers, with restrictions in vehicle manufacturing expected to be eased and tariffs on imported cars to be lowered, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday.In a keynote speech at the opening session of the annual conference of Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) held in South China's Hainan Province, President Xi singled out the car industry, among others, as an area for the country's continued reform and opening-up."In manufacturing, China has basically opened up this sector with a small number of exceptions on automobiles, ships and aircraft. These industries are now in a position to open up. Going forward, we will reduce as soon as possible limits on foreign investment in these industries, automobiles in particular," Xi said, according to the Xinhua News Agency.Xi also said that as part of China's efforts to actively expand imports, China will lower tariffs on imported cars by a "considerable degree," among other imported goods.Xi's remarks regarding the auto industry were welcomed by foreign leaders on Tuesday.In a panel discussion at the BFA, Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl said that the part of President Xi's speech relating to further opening to foreign investment in car manufacturing was the most striking to her, because the auto industry is important to the Europe.China currently levies on a 25 percent tariff on all imported cars, and under current regulation, foreign automakers must form a joint venture (JV) with a Chinese partner in order to enter the Chinese market.While Chinese officials have previously said that China would address the two issues, Xi's remarks on Tuesday mean swift action will follow, some experts noted.Zeng Zhiling, an analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy LMC Automotives, said that many foreign carmakers choose to form JVs with local Chinese partners not just because of the regulations but because they need the local expertise. "Even if they can operate fully independently, many would still choose to have a local partner," he told the Global Times Tuesday.Zeng also noted that Chinese companies could help the foreign carmakers to further expand their market reach in China."With President Xi mentioning [the issues] at such an important international occasion, I think it means China is ready to make concrete progress very soon," Mei Songlin, vice president and managing director at global auto market research firm J.D. Power China, told the Global Times Tuesday.Mei said that improved conditions in the domestic industry also support the government's plan to further open up the market. "I think the auto industry has reached the right situation for further opening-up. In recent years, Chinese carmakers - both State-owned and private ones such as SAIC Motor, Geely and BYD - have witnessed great development. I think that's where the confidence comes from."Also, the announcement of further opening-up in the auto industry should be put into the broader context of China's determination to continue the reform and opening-up policies that have propelled to country to the world's second-largest economy, experts noted."These efforts are long in the making even in the auto industry," Zeng said, pointing to China's efforts to reduce tariffs in recent years as part of its commitment to the WTO."China's tariffs on imported cars have been reduced to a lower level than many countries in Asia, such as India and the ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations]," Zeng said. If implemented, the announced measures will benefit foreign vehicle producers, particularly those that make premium cars, according to the two experts."This is definitely good news for companies that import cars to the Chinese market. Lower tariffs mean lower prices and lower prices mean bigger sales," Mei said. "This is particularly good news for premium car maker because most imported cars are premium models."In 2017, China imported 1.22 million cars, increasing 16.8 percent year-on-year, according to data released by the China Automobile Dealers Association in February. German carmakers BMW Group and Mercedes-Benz were the top two importers, with BMW importing 187,373 units and Mercedes-Benz importing 183,537, according to the data. Other top car importers include Japan's Lexus and the US' Lincoln.Ma Jingjing contributed to this story Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Trump's car tariff tweet distorts truth Asia needs to be wary of militarism revival in JapanChina, Austria agree to establish friendly strategic partnership Remembering the 'Flying Tigers' eight decades laterSafety doubts leave self-driving cars facing uphill battle for public trustConcern as identity theft grows How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
