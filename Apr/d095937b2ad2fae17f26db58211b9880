A turf war over China's emerging artificial intelligence (AI) translator market is heating up, as reflected at the ongoing Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) in Boao, South China's Hainan Province where Tencent and AI start-up iFlytek are providing AI-enabled transcription and translation services. Tencent's AI simultaneous interpretation machine, which installed coding program in a laptop, has two functions: creating transcripts and providing simultaneous interpretation. The machine made its debut at a session on "Future Production" on Monday, according to a statement the company sent to the Global Times. Meanwhile, iFlytek's new-generation AI portable voice product iFlytek translation machine 2.0 is also supplying shorthand and translation services at the forum. The Global Times saw that the device not only provides translation between Chinese and other five languages (English, Japanese, Korean, French and Portuguese); it also supports photographing and translation.The iFlytek device is equipped with the function of Neural Machine Translation, which enables people to use the machine in places where there are no network signals.Both technologies attracted huge attention at the forum. The Global Times saw that many foreign representatives were trying out iFlytek's device during the forum, while Tencent's AI simultaneous interpretation device got wide media attention.Tencent said in the statement sent to the Global Times that the accuracy of the AI simultaneous interpretation machine averages 97 percent and about 92 percent of the users can understand the translation, but the company experienced a "Waterloo" in its first appearance. The machine translated some guest speakers' Chinese into a garbled sequence of character and repetitive English words during the session. It also translated some speakers' English into broken and meaningless Chinese.According to a screen capture that went viral on the internet on Tuesday, the machine translated the "Belt and Road" initiative into "a road and a waistband," which prompted widespread ridicule online.Industry insiders said that the mistakes showed that there is still a long way to go before machines can replace human beings in simultaneous interpretation due to the technological bottlenecks in AI algorithms, deep learning and natural language understanding.Du Lan, senior vice president of iFlytek, told the Global Times that "it's inevitable that high-tech products make mistakes. We should hold an open attitude toward new technologies and allow time for improvement."
