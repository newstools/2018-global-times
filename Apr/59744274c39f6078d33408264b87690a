President Xi Jinping will attend the 2018 Boao Forum for Asia and deliver a keynote speech at the opening ceremony, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.Xi is expected to share insights on China's reform and opening-up and announce the country's new opening-up measures at the forum, which Chinese experts said will "reassure the world" amid rising protectionism and bolster global confidence in China's economy.The forum, scheduled from April 8 to 11 in Boao, South China's Hainan Province, is themed "An Open and Innovative Asia for a World of Great Prosperity."As this year also marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up, Xi will address key points such as the achievements of the policy and how the policy has influenced the world while also announcing "important measures" for further opening-up, according to Wang. It will be the third time Xi attends the forum as Chinese president. Lin Guijun, vice president at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, predicted that the financial, service and general manufacturing sectors will open up further to foreign investors. "For example, in the financial sector, the country will also relax or even lift limits on foreign firms' shareholding," Lin told the Global Times. Bai Ming, deputy director of the International Market Research Institute under the Ministry of Commerce, told the Global Times that the Belt and Road initiative would be another highlight, especially exclusive projects that can only be facilitated via the initiative."China has entered a new era and is now positioned at the start of a new development phase," Wang said at the press conference. The forum would provide a channel for China to explain and share its new development concept and targets as well as how it will bring new opportunities to the world, he added. Xi's presence against the backdrop of rising global trade tensions will assure the world that China will continue to open up to the world and let more partners see opportunities, Bai said.Lin agreed. He likened China's role to a "stabilizer" that will cement economic ties among countries and contribute to global integration. The forum, expecting more than 2,000 guests from all over the world, would contribute Chinese "wisdom and strength" to helping jointly explore development solutions to global challenges, Wang said.
