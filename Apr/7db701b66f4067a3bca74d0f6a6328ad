The US' planned tariffs on Chinese goods violate WTO rules and China can win the case after the country seeks help from the world body, an expert said Tuesday.The US unilateral sanctions, which are based on its domestic laws and rules, against China violates WTO rules and Chinese authorities have made it clear that China will resort to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, He Weiwen, an executive council member at the China Society for the WTO, told the Global Times on Wednesday. He said, according to the WTO rules, any WTO member cannot unilaterally decide whether measures used by other members go against WTO rules, nor unilaterally adopt trade retaliation against other members if the member thinks its interests were damaged."Given the clear rules, China's lawsuit against the US through the WTO is like suing a thief who is stealing in the street," He noted, adding that China will definitely win the case under the WTO dispute settlement mechanism.Reflecting on a WTO case on the US Section 301 investigation about two decades ago can offer insight for today's situation, said He.The US launched the 301 investigations against its trading partners including Japan, the EU, Canada and Brazil in the 1980s, and "they had to choose to put up with it," He said, until the EU finally brought it to the WTO trade dispute settlement mechanism in 1998, requiring an adjudication on the legitimacy of 301 measures.Under much pressure from the international community, the US had to make a promise, saying it could not take unilateral measures according to the 301 investigation results.Liu Jianwei, a partner at Beijing-based ZhongLun Law Firm, told the Global Times Wednesday that the WTO needs time to try the case and the results might come out a year later. If the case is more complicated, then it will take more time, he said."However, Chinese products have been restricted during that period, so we have to have mental preparation," Liu noted.The significance of resorting to the WTO multilateral mechanism, as far as Liu is concerned is that it can have a warning effect on the US, preventing it from making further moves."From the current prospective, the Trump administration is very likely to launch more 301 investigations against China," he added.
