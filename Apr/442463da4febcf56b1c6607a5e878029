Doublove, a brand under EP Yaying, held its 2018 autumn/winter collection launch on March 25 in Sanlitun, Beijing.A name derived from the two sides of love, Doublove targets younger consumers who love themselves more than other generations, which is different from Yaying's primary target, career women.With the theme of "encounter," models on the T-stage showcased more than 40 new products at the event. Models included Estelle Chen, Pei Bei and Wang Xinyu. The fashion show was part of the China Fashion Week and organized into three categories: environmentally friendly sustainable development, business development trends of the fashion industry and an art auditorium.In addition to a traditional press release, online live shows are also simultaneously being broadcast on different social media platforms. Video bloggers are actively promoting the event live on-site, which has become a common practice in the global fashion industry.
