Chinese products targeted by the US's latest proposed tariffs based upon results from investigation 301 accounts for 2.2 percent of China's total export, and the situation is still controllable, a Chinese expert said on Wednesday.The move clearly targets "Made in China 2025," a blueprint for upgrading the country's manufacturing sector, said Dong Yan a research fellow with the Institute of World Economics and Politics under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences."Based on 2017 bilateral trade data between China and the US, the volume of targeted goods accounted for 11.6 percent of China's total export to the US, and 2.2 percent of China's total export, which is still bearable," Dong told the Global Times on Wednesday.However, it should remain cautious on the fact that the US launched measures aimed at China's future competiveness, the expert warned. "China will carry out proportionate measures soon. In the short term, the two countries have entered into an intense period, but the situation is still controllable," Dong added."China has made positive efforts for negotiation between the two sides, but the US' move further reduces room for possible negotiation. The US will definitely be retaliated against," said Bai Ming, deputy director of the International Market Research Institute under the Ministry of Commerce."We have to let Donald Trump feel the brunt of a trade war, otherwise the US will continue to bully China in the coming decades," Bai told the Global Times on Wednesday. He noted that "Chinese value the idea that 'Harmony is the most precious," but it should not be at the cost of the China's rights and interests.China's ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Wednesday morning that the US's proposed tariffs on 1,300 Chinese goods deliberately violated WTO rules. The proposed tariffs, unveiled by the Office of the US Trade Representative on Tuesday (US time), violated WTO principals and rules such as most-favored-nation and tariff restrictions, said Zhang Xiangchen, the ambassador, according to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce."It's typical unilateralism and protectionism," he said. China will immediately report the US practices to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism and call on all WTO members to work with China to resolutely resist US trade protectionism, he noted. Zhang also reminded that "Section 301" was rampant and notorious in the history of world trade, which has been resisted by many countries.
