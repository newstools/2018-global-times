A Beijing-based blogger insists he is innocent and that the story that got him in detention was a fiction novel that has no relation to China's giant diary company Yili Group, his lawyer said Thursday.  Police arrested Liu Chengkun in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region over an alleged libel offense on April 2. Liu remains in detention in Hohhot, his lawyer Feng Yanqiang told Global Times on Thursday. Liu's story about "Xiongnu dairy company's CEO Mister Pan" was low-pitched until it was quoted by another WeChat public account, "Finance Street Detective," with the latter claiming that "the story revealed inside stories involving dairy giant Yili Group and its CEO, Pan Gang, although homophonic names were used."When he found out that his story's influence ran counter to his original intent, Liu deleted the post, the China Youth Daily reported Thursday. Liu also claimed that his story was totally fictitious based on disclosures and online information, and was not meant to insinuate anything, the report said."What Liu posted was a fiction novel that didn't fabricate any facts… general readers will not associate the story with Yili Group… and Liu wrote it without any subjective intent," Feng said."Even in libel cases, the plaintiff should consider himself as being slandered. The case should not be a public prosecution and there's no legal basis for the detention," Feng said.The story only meant to attract more subscribers, Liu told the newspaper.On April 7, a statement released by Yili Group said that the widely spreading "fake story" has hurt the group's image and business, and affected its CEO's reputation.The incident happened after a high-profile case in which Guangdong-based doctor Tan Qindong was detained after he wrote an article, claiming that the popular Chinese Hongmao medicinal liquor is poison.  Tan was later released on bail after the procuratorate cited a lack of evidence and returned the case to the public security department for further investigation.
