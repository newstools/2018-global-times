Experts said the frequent communication and exchanges between Chinese and French political leaders show that both countries not only express their common stance on globalization and countering protectionism but also work together to seek solutions and countermeasures. "The international situation is changing, and China and France share the pressure from rising protectionism and counter-globalization." So, the two countries are frequently reciprocating visits among its senior officials and leaders, said Cui Hongjian, director of the China Institute of International Studies' Department of European Studies.Before Philippe left France for China, he met Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor on Thursday in Paris, according to news.gov.hk, the official website of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

As a key member of the EU, the French prime minister's trip might also be meant to show stability and unity within the EU to China," Cui said.In an interview with Chinese financial news website yicai.com, Philippe said he will bring a concrete list of projects on cooperation in the Belt and Road initiative to Beijing. "These projects underwent consultations with relevant French institutes and departments, and we are capable of implementing these projects," he said.On trade and globalization, France found the US under the Trump administration is unreliable, so it has to boost cooperation with China, and French companies can find opportunities in the Belt and Road initiative, said Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University.Philippe will also visit Beijing and Shanghai, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
