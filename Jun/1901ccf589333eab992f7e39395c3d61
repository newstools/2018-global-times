China won five grand gold medals this year at the 2018 Concours Mondial de Bruxelles (CMB) - one of the world's top tasting events. This is a considerable achievement considering that three years ago the country had never won a single medal at the event. "Only 1 to 2 percent of competitors are awarded a grand gold medal, which means their quality has to be very, very good," CMB president Baudouin Havaux told the Global Times at a Beijing award ceremony for the Chinese winners held last week.Some 400 wine judges from around the world gathered in Beijing in mid-May to grade 9,180 samples from 48 countries and regions, the first time that the CMB competition has ever been held outside of Europe.But why China? "Because China is a dynamic market, in terms of both wine consumption and production," Havaux said at the award ceremony.Bottles of the winning Chinese wines were on display at the event, where their winemakers happily helped pour glass after glass for visitors. The proud winners watched on as their wine bottles received labels pronouncing them as the winners - a strong marketing catalyst."Winning a CMB medal can help push up prices by 30 percent at least," said one of the winemakers.And in terms of quality, "China-produced wines should be given a big thumb-up for frequent winning at international competitions in recent years," Zhang Yan, a national wine competition judge and the chief winemaker of one of the CMB's grand gold medal winners this year, told the Global Times.Growing industryRanking fifth after the US, France, Italy and Germany, China accounted for 7 percent of the world's total wine consumption in 2017, according to figures from the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV).In terms of production, China has already become the second-largest grape grower in the world following Spain.For many working in the industry, this is already an impressive achievement considering that China's wine industry has been around for a far shorter time than traditional wine countries."China's modern wine industry started just a century ago with the establishment of its first wine brand Changyu, and that's why we still have a lot to learn from foreign winemakers," Cao Ai, founder of the CMB-winning Huaigu Winery from Central China's Hebei Province, told the Global Times.Though many local winemakers at the event admitted their key wine-making machines were imported from abroad and that they have recruited foreign winemakers, "we're establishing our own systems - a good foreign winemaker does not necessarily produce a wine that is popular in China because they know little about the market," said Cao, who has spent years cooperating with winemakers from Chile and France."Chinese prefer wine that has a milder and more delicate texture rather than a strong, acidic taste - that's also what we should pay attention to in order to cater to domestic market," said Zhang.Entering popular cultureFor many Chinese today, wine is often viewed as a foreign product and the rituals and cultural background behind it often perplex those who know little about it. "I used to feel awkward ordering wine at a Western restaurant, since I was afraid that I might be judged by my French client just because I chose the wrong wine to go with our meal," Zheng Li, a Beijing-based office worker who recently attended a class about wine etiquette as part of his company's business training courses, told the Global Times.It's not just businessmen that feel the need to learn more about wine culture; young Chinese men and women who are looking for a different lifestyle are also becoming curious.Zhu Bo, a 26-year-old Beijing-based wine critic and a Level 2 Wine & Spirit Education Trust certificate holder, said learning about wine has brought more enjoyment into her life and has even impacted her life philosophy."For instance, while many big wine producers try to control every link of the production chain to produce wines that taste the same each year, some French winemakers tend to go with the flow and produce wines that have different flavors - that philosophy kind of impacted my attitude toward life," Zhu told the Global Times.To cater to the growing demand for wine culture education, Chinese universities and colleges based in some of the country's largest wine-producing areas such as Shandong Province and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have opened more wine-related majors.Moreover, the rising popularity of wine-focused mobile apps and social media bloggers have also given people easy access to resources that people can use to learn more about wine culture. "But I still want to go abroad to study wine in foreign vineyards sometime in the future - you know, it's where the culture originated," Zhu said.Once regarding wine as a symbol of social status and taste, Chinese people are changing their mindset concerning this Western-originated beverage. Seeing more and more Chinese diners ordering wine together with baijiu - a popular Chinese grain liquor - at restaurants, Zhang said that wine culture has a good chance of blending with local culture to create a new dining fashion someday."I suggest Chinese diners who seldom drink wine to forget all about etiquette and just try and taste it in anyway they are comfortable with - it might open a new world," he said.Newspaper headline: Improving tastes Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Beijing's women-only mosque blends Islam with Chinese traditionChinese teens born after 2000 more independent and open-minded about gaokaoTerrorism moving from Middle East to Southeast Asia, warns Chinese expert at Singapore forum Tough punishment creates respect between teens, lawUSC president to step downMemorial Day How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
