Domestic smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc filed an application to issue Chinese Depository Receipts (CDRs), according to a Monday morning announcement posted on the official website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). Xiaomi's filing came just a few days after the announcement of new regulations for the listing of "new-economy companies" in China's domestic stock market, experts said, noting that China expects CDR reform will promote a more competitive financial market.Xiaomi's is the first application for CDRs, a new type of security that allows the trade of overseas securities in domestic stock markets. Other domestic technology giants such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba have also shown interest in issuing CDRs, according to media reports. Experts said that domestic technology giants will soon flock to domestic stock markets."Issuing CDRs is like giving themselves an additional salary, so most companies that fit the requirements will not miss this chance," Yang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund Management Co, told the Global Times on Monday.The CSRC detailed the pilot program to allow leading companies from a list of eight strategic high-technology sectors such as internet, microchips or biopharmaceuticals to issue shares in domestic markets under a different set of requirements from traditional companies, according to a document the CSRC published on June 6."This reform is the biggest breakthrough in the financial markets in 20 years," said Dong Dengxin, director of the Financial Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology. "High-tech companies with no profits will be able to raise funds domestically, lowering the legal threshold so that promising start-ups can enter the stock market," Dong told the Global Times on Monday. The document said that companies that issue CDRs should have a market capitalization in their overseas listings of at least 200 billion yuan ($31 billion). Companies without overseas listings can list shares in domestic market provided they have a valuation of at least 20 billion yuan and revenue of more than 3 billion yuan.Experts noted that the changes will greatly raise the importance of China's technology sector in the financial markets."Right now, the A shares are dominated by traditional sectors such as construction and finance. With the new rules, many investors will probably move their funds from traditional sectors into these big technology companies, giving more weight to the new-economy sector and changing the whole structure of the Chinese stock market," said Yang.
