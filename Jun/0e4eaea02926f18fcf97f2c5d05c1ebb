Some 105 suspects involved in 10 million yuan ($1.5 million) of telephone scams, texting tricks and online fraud flew into Tianjin airport after being deported from Indonesia, municipal police said Thursday.The two planes, carrying suspects linked to over 200 criminal cases in provinces and cities across China, arrived at Tianjin Binhai International Airport on Wednesday night, according to an official Sina Weibo microblog statement published by Tianjin's public security bureau. In May, the Ministry of Public Security sent a Tianjin police team to Indonesia to work with Indonesian police in targeting and breaking three dens of telephone scam artists situated on Bali Island.Southeast Asian countries including Myanmar and Cambodia are popular destinations for Chinese scamsters.In 2017, the ministry assigned 17 squads to more than 20 foreign nations to bust about 1,000 telecom and online fraud suspects, the Xinhau News Agency reported. A total  of 128 telecom fraud dens were cracked. Domestically, more than 780,000 telecom and online fraud cases were busted in 2017 involving more than 47,000 criminals, up 55.2 percent compared with the previous year, Xinhua said. Losses of 300 million yuan ($47.3 million) were retrieved and given back to victims in 2017, according to the report. Cross-border fraud groups are strictly organized and concealed. Moving their operations overseas increases the challenge for China's law enforcement authorities.
