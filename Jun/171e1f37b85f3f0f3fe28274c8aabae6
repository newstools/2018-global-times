On the occasion of its 30th anniversary of business operation on the Chinese mainland, Foxconn Technology Group announced that it will be stepping up efforts to promote intelligent manufacturing and boost the integration of the internet, big data and artificial intelligence with the real economy. The move is a bid to scrap its image as a low-cost assembler of electronic devices and to transform itself into an advanced manufacturer based on industrial internet.On its 30th anniversary of operating on the Chinese mainland, Taiwan-headquartered Foxconn, the world's largest contract manufacturer of electronics, announced its ambition to make foray into the intelligent manufacturing sector based on its rich industrial data.Widely known as a key producer of Apple's iPhones, Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, entered the Chinese mainland market in 1988. Foxconn now hosts its largest factory in Shenzhen, a former fishing village in South China's Guangdong Province, now dubbed "China's Silicon Valley." Speaking on the anniversary during a ceremony held in the city on Wednesday, Foxconn's founder and chairman, Terry Gou, said the industrial internet age has come, meaning "we are currently witnessing a transformation from traditional manufacturing to deep integration of the real and digital economies.""Based on our 30 years of experience in innovation and precision manufacturing, we'll transfer industrial data to artificial intelligence [AI], since we have core technologies in Internet of Things [IoT], big data and cloud computing, as well as industrial robots, which can also help support small and medium-sized enterprises," Gou noted."We stress 'plus internet' instead of the 'internet plus' mode," Gou said, referring to the real economy integrating with the virtual economy.While the "internet plus" mode empowers traditional industries, plus internet relies more on industry instead of an internet mind-set, which only plays the role of an assistant, an industry insider, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Global Times on the sidelines of the ceremony.From an economic perspective, industrial internet could generate $82 trillion globally by 2025, accounting for half of the world's total current economic output, according to Gou.Foxconn Industrial Internet Co (FII), a Foxconn unit focusing on industrial internet, got listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Friday, the first stock ever in the sector. According to a statement it disclosed on May 23, the unit is aiming to raise 27.12 billion yuan ($4.2 billion), the biggest IPO related to the technology, media and telecommunications sector since 2015.It plans to use the proceeds to fund eight projects related to industrial internet, cloud computing, 5G and industry upgrades.The day before FII's IPO, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released guidelines on the development of industrial internet, pointing out the aim to build infrastructure and industrial systems in the sector by the end of 2020.The guidelines also promoted the establishment of industrial internet platforms, as well as the cultivation of a batch of independently operating platforms at the enterprise level, as shown on the ministry's website.Separately, in November 2017, the State Council, China's cabinet, issued guidelines outlining the aim to build three to five industrial internet platforms that will reach international standards by 2025."The company is introducing BEACON - Foxconn's own industrial internet platform - to each plant, and we want to establish unmanned plants with our more than 60,000 industrial robots, freeing human labor from the assembly line," FII Chairman Chen Yongzheng was quoted as saying in a sohu.com report on Friday.Future of manufacturing In recent years, Foxconn has ramped up efforts to scrap its reputation as a "global contractor" that heavily relies on manufacturing electronic devices, and shifted to diversify its business by making manufacturing smarter.Yuan Xiaoqing, an industry analyst at Beijing-based CCID Consulting, said during a panel discussion after the ceremony that "contractor" is not necessarily a negative word in terms of being an industrial internet platform, which emphasizes openness, value and ecology."In the traditional phase, Foxconn manufactures Apple's products but does not own the brand. But for an industrial internet platform, it needs another domain's know-how, as well as its algorithms and models - all of which, if put onto BEACON one day, will become very powerful," Yuan opined, adding that the company is expected to soon catch up with those in Germany and the US.As far as Yuan is concerned, Foxconn should continue playing the role of a "contractor" over the next 30 years in the industrial internet sector, which has become a new focus for today's manufacturing industry competitors.He Dongdong, CEO of industrial internet platform RootCloud, agreed, saying industrial internet must act as the core of future manufacturing, while expressing confidence in manufacturing enterprises such as Foxconn and Sany Heavy Industry in their abilities to take the lead with their domain knowledge and rich industrial data.While China's rapidly developing internet technology in the consumption area has a relatively short learning curve in terms of its talent in cloud computing and big data analytics, the learning curve of the industrial use field is very long, He told the panel, adding that it's impossible to catch up with Foxconn's industrial accumulation ability over a short period. "The contractor has forged its unique advantage in precision manufacturing over these years, from which even Apple cannot walk away," the anonymous insider noted.Playing catch-upStrong manufacturing countries have their own unique features and advantages, for example, German machinery, Japanese craftsmanship and US technology. Relatively speaking, technology can bring more value and services, said Jay Lee, a professor at Ohio's University of Cincinnati who attended the ceremony.China is shifting from being the world's largest manufacturing powerhouse to the world's strongest, with advanced and intelligent manufacturing technology driving the "Made in China 2025" initiative."This is not a trade conflict but rather a competition of technology," said Gou in a video shown during the ceremony, referring to the ongoing China-US trade dispute.In such areas as jet engines and semiconductors, Gou said, the US remains ahead of China. "If China is to catch up, it must be in the areas of design and manufacturing technology, which are the real economy," he said."If we let engineers or experienced workers study AI, they'll adapt more quickly," he added, highlighting the shift from craftsmanship to industrial internet.
