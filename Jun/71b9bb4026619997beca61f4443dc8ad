A recent crackdown on major foreign chipmakers followed abnormal rises in prices of memory chips in recent years, and it showed the government's determination to fight unfair practices in the Chinese market, industry insiders said. After Samsung China confirmed that the company was cooperating with an ongoing investigation by Chinese antitrust authorities, another South Korean memory semiconductor producer - SK Hynix - told the Global Times on Monday that it "could not say anything further other than that we are cooperating with the investigation."Semiconductor industry website Jiweinet reported on Friday that the Chinese antitrust agency launched a sudden investigation at the Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen offices of Samsung, SK Hynix Inc and Micron Technology Inc on Thursday seeking certain information.The report said that investigations may have been sparked by concern about continued price increases for memory chips in China.US chipmaker Micron had not responded to an interview request by the Global Times as of press time. But the company confirmed to Bloomberg News on Friday that it was being investigated by Chinese regulators. Since the antitrust authority began talks with Samsung at the end of last year, investigations into major memory chipmakers have continued, Wang Yanhui, head of the Shanghai-based Mobile China Alliance, told the Global Times. "The antitrust investigation not only targets foreign companies in China, but also China's State-owned enterprises, and the major objective is to maintain a fair environment," Wang said. "After the Qualcomm case, Chinese companies learned to report alleged unfair practices to the Chinese authorities, which led to this investigation," Wang said. The National Development and Reform Commission, the top economic regulator in China, fined US chipmaker Qualcomm 6 billion yuan ($975 million) in 2015 for its dominance in wireless technology and charging "unfairly high" licensing fees. "It's a similar case to Qualcomm. Smartphone companies, which are constantly paying high licensing fees, reported this to the government, which launched an investigation into antitrust allegations," Liu Kun, vice general manager of the IC Industry Research Center at CCID Consulting, told the Global Times. "Companies were told that rising memory chip prices reflected inventory shortages, which has not been obvious," he said, noting that after companies reported the situation to the authorities in China, investigations began. Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron have already been named in a class action lawsuit in California over alleged price conspiracies involving dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, a US newswire for business lawyers called law360.com reported in April. Customer groups said that the three companies control almost the entire DRAM market, law360.com said.According to DRAMeXchange, the memory and storage division of market research provider TrendForce, the top three suppliers - Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron - had shares of 44.9 percent, 27.9 percent and 22.6 percent respectively in the DRAM market.
