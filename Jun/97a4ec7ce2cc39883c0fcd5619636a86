Chinese President Xi Jinping awarded the first friendship medal of the People's Republic of China to Russia President Vladimir Putin at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Friday afternoon.Analysts said that the medal represents the Chinese people's admiration and appreciation for Putin's contribution to promoting China-Russia ties to the highest level."This is the first time for China to award a foreign leader a friendship medal since it was set up in January 2016, which reveals that China attaches great importance to the China-Russia ties," Li Guofu, a researcher at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday.Li said that leaders of the two countries have developed a personal friendship.According to China's law on national medals and honorary titles, friendship medals, one of the highest state honors, are to be presented to foreigners who have made outstanding contributions to China's socialist modernization drive, promoted exchange and cooperation between China and the world, and safeguarded world peace."Putin deserves the medal. For the past 18 years, he has played an active role in promoting China-Russia ties," Wang Lijiu, an expert of Russian studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times."China and Russia have developed a comprehensive strategic partnership during Putin's tenure. The quality of the bilateral ties has been enhanced," Wang said.In July 2017, Putin awarded Xi the Order of St. Andrew for his distinguished service to the peoples of China and Russia. The Order of St. Andrew, the Apostle of the First-Called, is the highest order of Russia and is awarded for outstanding service to the state, Russia News Agency Tass reported.China and Russia have enjoyed the best friendship and their non-alignment ties have set an example to the international community. Future bilateral cooperation may focus on comprehensively supporting each other, especially on the economy and it will help promote the middle region of Europe, Wang said.
