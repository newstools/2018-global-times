Three government departments including Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and the State Administration of Radio and Television arranged talks with domestic online video-making and sharing app Meipai on Sunday, ordering the latter to carry out comprehensive rectification of its content.According to a statement published by the CAC on Sunday, Meipai has been spreading vulgar information involving juveniles, which has destroyed the internet ecosystem. Meipai on Saturday apologized for the emergence of "content and phenomena not matching the core socialist values" on its platform. According a letter by Wu Xinhong, CEO of parent company Meitu Inc, Meipai "betrayed" social trust and expectations, and he apologized to the regulators and users on behalf of the Meipai team. The letter was posted on the front page of the Meipai app on Saturday. Wu said that Meipai will halt updating the content on its hot channel from June 2 to July 2, and will halt updating the content on its live-streaming channel from June 2 to June 17. He also announced that Meipai will shut down the "campus" channel. Wu, when contacted by the Global Times on Sunday, said that his opinion was thoroughly reflected in the apology letter and he had no further comment to make.Some Weibo users on Sunday commented that the apology letter reflected Meipai's eagerness to survive, in a response to a caijing.com.cn post about the incident involving Meipai.Zhang Kai, senior marketing director of Meitu, told the Global Times on Sunday that Meipai's reform mainly aimed to regulate juvenile videos. He said that Meipai has in the past launched measures to ban juvenile videos, but some juveniles use their parents' accounts to launch videos on Meipai, which is hard to check. Liu Dingding, a veteran industry analyst, told the Global Times on Sunday that as far as he knows, a lot of platforms have become like Meipai these days - they're very sensitive and would rather sacrifice certain content, which helped them make money, to avoid problems with regulators.
