A joint open letter from 11 Chinese photovoltaic (PV) industry leaders has said that they "strongly recommend" the government shouldn't be too rigid about cutting subsidies and curbing the scale of distributed PV, because overly aggressive reform would deal "a heavy blow to the whole industry," media reports said on Wednesday.Big industry names such as Liu Hanyuan, chairman of Tongwei Group, and Zhao Zhenyuan, vice president of the China Information Industry Trade Association, were among those signing the joint letter, which was sent to the Xinhua News Agency on Sunday."We hope that the government will listen more to the opinions of industry players and ensure that new policies are consistent with existing policies," the letter stated.Li Chuangjun, deputy director of the renewable energy department at the Nation Energy Administration, said late on Wednesday that PV power will remain a key force in the nation's energy revolution. Li also said that the government will work with enterprises to promote the sound and sustainable development of the PV industry, according to a statement on the public WeChat account of the China Photovoltaic Industry Association. "It's unavoidable that the new policy will bring some problems, and the government should figure out ways to deal with them. For example, some PV projects were built based on the assumption of subsidies, but since the subsidies are being reduced, losses might result," Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Wednesday."However, PV players could have anticipated that there would be cuts because of declining costs, with equipment prices down almost 10 times since 2007," Lin said.The timing of the policy shift is "more than reasonable," he said.On June 1, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance and the National Energy Administration announced a cut to the national feed-in-tariff by 0.05 yuan ($0.008) per kilowatt-hour and a reduction of the same amount in subsidies for power generated by distributed PV projects. Sungrow Group, whose chairman Cao Renxian also signed the letter, declined to give further details when contacted by the Global Times.However, Yingli Group told the Global Times on Wednesday that the company had "made an appeal to higher authorities," but it did not give further details about the appeal.Shares in the PV sector have been plummeting since the announcement of the policy change. For example, shares of Tongwei Group fell by 6.01 percent while shares of Sungrow Group have dropped 7.7 percent as of close time on Wednesday. Wang Junchao, general manager of Shenzhen-based PV technology company Dazu, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the Chinese solar manufacturing industry will face hard times under the new policy.He said that the letter "said exactly what he wanted to say and predicted precisely what the industry will face once the policy is in force.""The policy changed all of a sudden. It's just not the right time to cut subsidies in the industry. Give us two or three years, we won't need subsidies at all by that time," Wang said.While Lin noted that short-term pain is unavoidable, people should look at the big picture in the long term. "The new policy will force companies to improve their technology and rein in excessive expansion, and it will encourage them to seek opportunities abroad," Lin said.Newspaper headline: Solar leaders' letter calls for rethink on subsidies Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Buddhist representatives in Tibet undergo training, urged to be politically reliableUS warships unwelcome in Taiwan StraitsChinese amputee Xia Boyu achieves life-long goal of climbing the world's highest peak Tough punishment creates respect between teens, lawUSC president to step downMemorial Day How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
