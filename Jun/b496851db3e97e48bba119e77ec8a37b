The performance next week of a play by one of Australia's best-known playwrights at a Beijing theater festival has been called off, and organizers told the Global Times on Wednesday that the reason was its sexual language and violent content."The play was scheduled around June 12 but was disapproved by the culture department for sexual and violent content, and the performance has been canceled," a staff member at Penghao Theater, organizers of the Nanluoguxiang Theatre Festival, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Written in 1971 by David Williamson, The Removalists was already performed on June 2 at Peking University and Beijing Foreign Studies University before it was canceled. The Removalists explores dark themes around violence, masculinity, abuse and police brutality, Australia-based news portal ABC reported.Later adapted into a film, the play involves "macho belligerence and awful things" people can do if "wrong buttons are pushed," Williamson told ABC. The festival opened Tuesday in Beijing with the theme "Encourage original works, pay tribute to the artist, literature and beauty."The list of plays and performances during the festival needs to be reported to the culture department in Beijing at least 15 working days before performance, according to the theater staff member. Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture did not  respond as of press time.The Nanluoguxiang Theater Festival is an annual event in Beijing being held for its ninth time this year from June to December and is scheduled to show hundreds of stage plays.  The Removalists is the only play banned among 14 scheduled for performance in June, the staff member said.
