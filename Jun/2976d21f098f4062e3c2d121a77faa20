China's social media giant Sina Weibo continued to cleanse its platform in May by blocking or removing 141,000 posts that spread harmful information about current politics, Weibo announced on its official administrator account Monday. A total of 5,450 accounts were also restricted or deleted  for the same reason, an increase of 355 percent compared with April.More than 1.31 million posts that spread pornographic information or violated laws have been deleted, while Weibo's system automatically intercepted 306,000 pornographic posts. A total of 7,237 accounts were closed for spreading porn."All Weibo's operations are based on community convention and to maintain the platform's order," an anonymous publicity employee of Sina Weibo told the Global Times on Tuesday.Harmful posts could mislead other users and pollute the cyberspace environment, Wang Sixin, a law professor at the Beijing-based Communication University of China, told Global Times on Tuesday.Illegal and harmful content could drive out good ones, leading to irrational comments that generate even greater harm, Wang added.Sina Weibo registered 392 million active users in 2017, according to the Weibo Data Center, 15.7 percent of whom were adolescents.Weibo began to cleanse its platform years ago, and its administrator account began releasing reports on its cleaning operations in June 2016.Weibo's move was in response to the government's call to safeguard cyber sovereignty and conform to relevant laws, Wang said.It is Weibo's responsibility to supervise no matter who created the account, Wang said, noting that all institutes, including foreign embassies that provide information on Weibo, should comply with Chinese laws and platform rules.The Cyberspace Administration of China issued regulation for microblog services in February 2018 to promote its sound and ordered development.Weibo's cleansing of its platform protects its users' rights and interests, and safeguards social order, Zhu Wei, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times previously.
