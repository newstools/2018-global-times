"We haven't opened it yet, but it is much more delicate than other boxes we found in other halls."The box will be placed back on the roof after the restoration work is completed. The Hall of Mental Cultivation served as the  emperor's resting room in popular Chinese historical dramas like The Story of Yanxi Palace and Ruyi's Royal Love in the Palace. In reality, it was used to hold political activities. Eight emperors reigned there, making the hall the heart of politics during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
