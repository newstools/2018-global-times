A promotional event for the Palace Museum's "Calendar of the Forbidden City 2019" was held at the Palace of Establishing Happiness (Jianfugong) in Beijing's Forbidden City on Monday.  The calendar, which went on sale on the museum's online store in August, has earned many followers since it debuted 10 years ago."The calendar is on my 'to buy' list every year," tonlywei posted on the museum's official Sina Weibo on Monday. "I started buying the calendar when my daughter was born, and I will keep buying it until she grows up," netizen Xiaoquqimama_NaNa noted on Sina Weibo. The first calendar that came out in 2009 was based on a calendar designed by Feng Hua, a Palace Museum editor, in 1937.Over the past decade, the calendar has changed from a plain white and black design to a more colorful presentation that took its inspiration from the Chinese zodiac. The current calendar is red in color to match the walls of the Forbidden City. Square in shape, the calendar is affectionately referred to as "the red brick" by the general public. "The year 2019 will be the Year of the Pig," Chen Lihua, the chief editor of the calendar, told media at the event. "Pigs are a symbol of wealth and abundance in Chinese culture, therefore we selected 12 related themes for the calendar to depict this lucky pig, such as some utensils and containers from the collection with auspicious designs that represent wishes for increased wealth and fulfillment." This year's calendar features photos of some of the most valuable items from the Palace Museum's collection, such as a jade backscratcher known in Chinese as a ruyi, traditional Chinese paintings and elaborate porcelains that once belonged to ancient Chinese emperors.
