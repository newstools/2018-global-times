The second "China Day" returned to The British Raindance Film Festival on Thursday in London, UK.The Raindance Film Festival is the largest and most important independent film festival in the UK. Now in its 26th year, it is based in the heart of London's buzzing West End district. In conjunction with Dreamax, a Beijing based production and distribution outfit, the event offered a packed day of panel discussions on topics that included "International Co-Production and Filming in China", "Sales, Acquisition, and Legal Licensing for the Chinese Marketplace" and "Film Education between the UK and China".The festival also shared a special screening of Dude's Manual a 2018 Chinese romance-comedy film directed by Ke Mengrong, starring Dong Zijian, Elaine Zhong, and Jessie Li.In this years' "China Day" event, the faculty of the Arts and Social Sciences of Open University of China, Raindance Education, Dreamax, and China Vision Media jointly announced the launch of the China-UK Youth Film Exchange Project. The four parties will jointly help Chinese and British college students exchange ideas on film production. The project will serve as an educational platform for Chinese and British youths, creating more opportunities in the international film industry. According to Michael Bao, the founder and CEO of Dreamax Media, both China and the UK hold some of the most established talent within the global film industry. The event further explored how each country approached nurturing talent, the legal status of talent, how the relationship can grow between each country and how Chinese talent would suit the landscape of European films.Raindance, which kicked off on October 26 will run until October 7 at various venues in central London.The festival, which began in 1992, is considered one of the "50 Film Festivals worth the entry fee in 2018" by Movie Maker magazine.
