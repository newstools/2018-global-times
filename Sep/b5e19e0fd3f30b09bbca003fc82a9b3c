China is confident and capable of tackling challenges created by China-US trade frictions because the country's economy has great resilience and growth potential and the Chinese government will unveil measures to help stabilize its foreign trade, Chinese officials and experts said on Tuesday. A trade war is not in the interest of both the US and China, and China has always left its door open for consultations to address problems, Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said at a press conference held on Tuesday in Beijing.But restarting China-US talks depends on the US, and the preconditions are that the US is sincere and fair, and should keep its promises, Wang said.It is difficult to proceed with talks as the US is putting "a knife to China's neck" with its trade restrictions, the vice minister said.China canceled trade talks with the US and will not send Vice Premier Liu He to Washington, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend, citing sources.Confrontation between China and the US means both sides lose, and talks with Washington cannot take place under threats and pressure, Chinese Foreign Minister and State Councilor Wang Yi said during his meeting with US business leaders in New York, according to a statement posted on the website of China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday.Trade between China and the US is large, and it is normal to see some disputes because of the difference in economic development levels, social system and trade structures, Dong Dengxin, director of Wuhan University of Science and Technology's Finance and Securities Institute, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The US has benefitted from its trade with China, Dong said, noting that "trade disputes with the US also drive China to optimize its trade structure, increase exports of high added-value products and further enhance the competitiveness of foreign trade."US imposes "extreme pressure" on China as it fears the rapid growth of the Chinese economy threatens its competitiveness in advanced manufacturing sectors, said Bai Ming, deputy director of the Ministry of Commerce's International Market Research Institute.Talks are the proper way to resolve disputes instead of trade remedy measures, Bai contended.Experts said US trade measures will harm both countries, including companies, consumers and farmers.From January to July, China's agricultural imports from the US grew slowly while imports from other countries like Brazil and Australia fared much better, Vice Minister Wang said, noting that Germany overtook the US as the largest car supplier for the Chinese market during the same period.Help for SMEsChina published a white paper on Monday to clarify the facts about China-US economic and trade relations, demonstrate explicitly its stance on trade frictions with the US and pursue reasonable solutions. The document was released the very day US tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods took effect.Although the impact of US tariffs is inevitable, the risks are controllable because the Chinese economy has great resilience and growth potential, Lian Weiliang, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, said at the same press conference on Tuesday."The escalating trade frictions instigated by the US have made some foreign-funded enterprises in China consider leaving in a bid to disperse risks and lower cost," Vice Minister of Industry and Information Technology Luo Wen said at the same press conference. "We should treat this issue in a rational way," he said. China International Trade Representative and Vice Minister of Commerce Fu Ziying said at the same press conference that China is committed to protecting legal rights and interests of foreign-funded enterprises in the country. China will strengthen efforts to build an open and transparent law system concerning foreign affairs and improve its business environment for these firms, Fu said.This round of US tariffs will have some impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from both countries and will harm the global industrial chain, experts said."We are fully capable of addressing the impact of China-US trade frictions by expanding domestic demand and promoting high-quality development," Lian said.From January to July, the operations of SMEs above the national scale were largely stable, with industrial added value growing 7 percent year-on-year and profits rising 11.4 percent on a yearly basis.The Chinese government will continue to expand domestic demand and further cut taxes and fees to further stimulate SMEs, Luo said, adding that China will support SMEs' search for new markets, especially those along the Belt and Road initiative routes.In a bid to help SMEs offset the impact of trade tensions, China is likely to enhance the export rebate rate for some domestic firms and allow Chinese companies to use credit insurance to avoid potential risks when they expand into new overseas markets, Bai told the Global Times.Bai said that the Chinese government could also help domestic firms through public services and further facilitating trade for domestic companies.Newspaper headline: China to contain trade risks Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass China releases white paper on facts and its position on trade friction with USCritics of the China-Vatican deal merely the loud minority: bishopChina won't yield to US trade stick UA pilots under fire for napping during trans-Atlantic flightExpansion work on Garden of Flowing Fragrance to beginChina's climate change efforts highlighted in CA How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
