South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) agreed to hold the working-level talks on military affairs later this week, Seoul's Defense Ministry said Tuesday.The ministry said the two sides agreed to hold the 40th round of inter-Korean working-level military talks on Sept. 13 at Tongilgak, a DPRK building at the border village of Panmunjom.The DPRK side proposed the military dialogue, accepted by the South Korean side, according to the ministry.The military talks would come ahead of the summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and DPRK top leader Kim Jong Un, scheduled to be held in Pyongyang for three days from Sept. 18.The colonel-level military officers from the two sides were forecast to discuss ways to ease military tensions between the two Koreas, including the withdrawal of a part of guard posts inside the demilitarized zone (DMZ), which divides the two sides, on a trial basis.Also on the dialogue agenda would be ways to disarm the Joint Security Area (JSA) inside the Panmunjom and the joint excavation of the remains of fallen soldiers during the 1950-53 Korean War.Those issues were agreed upon by the two sides during the general-grade military talks in late July.
