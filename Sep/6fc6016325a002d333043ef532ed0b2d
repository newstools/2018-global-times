The Chinese tourist who was allegedly manhandled by Swedish police claimed to the Global Times that the police had hit his elderly parents in vehicles and demanded the release of relevant videos. A special prosecutor "is looking into the incident since it involved a police officer," Swedish foreign affairs department staff said when reached by Pear Video.Zeng is the surname of the Chinese tourist who, together with his parents, was reported to have been dragged out of a hotel by police in Stockholm and later dropped off near a cemetery. He refused to give his full name.Zeng's mother, 64, was taken in a police vehicle with her hands behind her back, and police allegedly hit her in the vehicle when she "was tired of the position and just moved her body a bit," Zeng recalled his mother's words to the Global Times on Sunday.His father, 67, was "rudely taken out" of the hostel they planned to stay by police and fainted when he was carried inside another police vehicle until he was "hit by the police on his chest," Zeng claimed.Zeng's father suffers from a heart disease, according to Zeng.Zeng claimed that he himself was also taken inside another vehicle, and he and his parents were then driven to an area close to a graveyard in Stockholm.Zeng and his parents traveled from China to Europe in mid-August, and arrived at a hostel in Stockholm in early morning of September 2, only to realize that they had arrived early and it was not yet check-in time.Aftonbladet, a newspaper in Stockholm, on Sunday quoted the hostel staff as saying they were verbally threatened by Zeng before they were "unable to respond to the situation and called the police.""It is a lie," Zeng told the Global Times on Sunday. "I never said any dirty words to the staff," he said.A viral video showed Zeng making an emotional appeal and throwing himself on the ground in front of the police.Thousands of Chinese net users and a Swedish passerby who recorded the scene suggested the man was play-acting.The comments on the internet were "tearing me to pieces," Zeng said. Net users only saw "a very small part of the whole incident," he said.Zeng called for the video and audio recordings, including those in the hostel and in the police vehicle, to be released, where the police's improper behavior took place."I doubt if they would release those recordings," Zeng said.
