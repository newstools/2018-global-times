China will take "all necessary measures" to safeguard its legal interests in foreign trade, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Thursday amid fears of an imminent trade war with the US.Analysts say China has already shown sincerity and willingness to compromise, and now it should show some strength."We have noticed that the US will announce the result of its Section 301 investigation and it will very likely launch actions against China. China has expressed its position on many occasions that we resolutely oppose this type of unilateral and protectionist action by the US," according to a statement on the official website of the MOFCOM on Thursday."The US has frequently mentioned the word 'fair,'" but "if the US urges China to buy what the US offers for sale, but then refuses to sell what China wants to buy, and then blames China for unbalanced trade, is this fair?" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at Thursday's press conference."China respects the concerns of the US. From the '100-day plan' to a $253.5 billion trade deal package, China has already made huge, sincere efforts to solve the problem of unbalanced China-US trade, but now it seems the US has no respect and no sincerity at all," Bai Ming, deputy director of the International Market Research Institute under the MOFCOM, told the Global Times on Thursday."China will not sit idly by while its legitimate rights and interests are being harmed. China will take all necessary measures to firmly defend our rights and interests," the MOFCOM statement said.US President Donald Trump is expected to announce new tariffs on Chinese imports, which is likely to trigger retaliation from Beijing and stoke fears of a global trade war.The White House said Trump will sign on Thursday a presidential memorandum targeting China's "economic aggression" under the pretense of curbing "theft of US technology."Make it hurt"There are two ways to deal with the US. One is surrender, which is impossible, and the other is to make it hurt. China needs a list of retaliatory measures, which might cover agriculture products, national debt, motor vehicles and planes. After seeing this list, the US will likely reconsider its action," Bai noted.Asked if China might retaliate by impacting trade on US soybeans and airplanes, Hua said that "China's departments which are responsible for trade and economy will respond appropriately.""We don't want a trade war with anyone, but if our hand is forced, we will not quail nor recoil," Hua said.China's retaliation will be based on international rules and the framework of the WTO, and it's likely to be very effective, said Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China.The Trump administration's pending trade sanctions are designed to serve his domestic politics, but a trade war will harm consumers and companies of both China and the US, said Diao, adding that Trump's decision-making is irresponsible as a trade war will only bring lose-lose consequences, and could impact the global economy.According to the Wall Street Journal, 45 trade associations, including the US Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation and the Information Technology Industry Council, signed a petition sent to the US government. The trade associations are urging the US government not to move forward with its tariff plan on Chinese imports, as it would hurt the US economy, consumers and competitiveness.Newspaper headline: US shows no sincerity on tackling trade issues: official Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass How subsidized US soybeans hurt Chinese farmersIndian scholars become masterminds behind new wave of 'China threat' theoryXi vows to safeguard territorial integrity, warns separatists Chinese-American,14, develops first app for Alzheimer's patientsStudying abroad costs more than just moneyAustin bomber blew himself up: police How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
