Activities such as lectures and group study of the Constitution will also be held, he said.In this year's proposal submitted to the national legislature, NPC deputy Shi Zewu, who is deputy head of the Buddhist Association of China, advocated compiling and printing an official book introducing the amended Constitution.He also suggested every family in China should have a copy of the book to study. "The book should appear in every household and social unit to increase the public's legal awareness and to help them understand how their life and work are related to and affected by the Constitution," Shi said.The proposed book should highlight the newly added parts, especially the part underlining Party leadership, to "help form joint efforts to achieve the great goal of the Chinese Dream," he said.All Chinese citizens, including religious practitioners should study the Constitution and act within the scope of law, according to Shi, who is also the abbot of Nanputuo Temple in Xiamen, East China's Fujian Province."It is especially necessary for religious people to study the Constitution and contribute their share in resisting extremism and separatist thoughts, while safeguarding social stability and revitalizing traditional culture," said Shi.Example for the worldTibetan deputy Gyaltsen said he believes the inclusion in the Constitution of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is among the most significant changes.The leadership of the CPC, which has been enshrined in the Constitution, ensures the success of China's legal and economic achievements, and sets an example for the world, said Luo Qi, a national political adviser and head of the China Nuclear Power Institute."As a judge, I feel a strong responsibility to faithfully fulfill my duty granted by the Constitution," said Li Ying, vice-president of the High People's Court in Tianjin.
