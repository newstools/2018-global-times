According to Huang, all the astronauts at the center have started to learn space station technology, mechanical arm technology and medicine.They have also conducted underwater exercises to simulate a space walk and will take survival training in deserts."Scientific tasks are the key and this has brought out new requests for astronauts," Jiao Weixin, a space science professor at Peking University, told the Global Times.Previously China's astronauts are mainly selected from pilots, Jiao said. "Now their selection also largely requires scientific knowledge.""Astronauts will be selected from a broader group, such as university graduates or young scientists, who could serve as engineers to conduct technical tasks," Jiao said.Sunday marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Astronaut Center of China. Since the human space project was initiated in 1992, the center has trained 21 astronauts and developed more than 4,000 space products, including a space suit, the China News Service reported.In September 1992, the government decided to implement a human space program and prescribed the "Three-step Strategy" of development, according to the official website of China Manned Space project.The third step is to establish a space station.China sent its first cargo spacecraft Tianzhou-1 in 2017, which successfully docked with the orbiting space lab Tiangong-2, as China entered the "new era of space stations," China News Service reported.Newspaper headline: Astronaut training in final stages Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Russian diplomat expulsions signal crude side of Western intentionChina prepares aircraft carrier for sea trialXi Jinping, Kim Jong Un hold talks in Beijing Remembering the 'Flying Tigers' eight decades laterSafety doubts leave self-driving cars facing uphill battle for public trustConcern as identity theft grows How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
