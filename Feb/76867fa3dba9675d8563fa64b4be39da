The Chinese-made C919 large passenger aircraft has received 30 new orders from a domestic leasing company, taking total orders to 815. Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) signed an agreement with China Huarong Financial Leasing Co for 30 C919 planes and 20 ARJ21 aircraft on Monday in Beijing. The C919 passenger jet, China's bid to rival Boeing Co's 737 and the Airbus A320, completed its first long-distance flight in November 2017.To date, the C919 has gained 815 orders from 28 customers in China and abroad. ARJ21 orders have hit 453 from 21 customers. China Huarong Financial Leasing Co is a subsidiary of China Huarong Asset Management Co, one of the country's largest asset management companies. "We expect to establish a comprehensive cooperative relationship with COMAC," said Lai Xiaomin, chairman of China Huarong Asset Management Co. COMAC's ARJ21, a regional aircraft with 90 economy-class seats, was delivered to Chengdu Airlines in late 2015. It has so far carried 49,000 passengers, the company said. The C919 is in the test flight phase following a successful maiden flight on May 5, 2017. The narrow-body jumbo was developed to rival the updated Airbus A320 and the new Boeing B737. COMAC has also set up a joint venture with a Russian state company to build the wide-body passenger jet CR929.
