The summit between the Russian and US presidents will not have much of an influence on China since China is a more active partner of Russia, Chinese experts said on Tuesday, dismissing previous reports that the two global giants might form an alliance against China.The Helsinki summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump on Monday will not influence China-Russia and China-US relations, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a daily press briefing on Tuesday."We have full confidence in the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination. We are also very consistent and clear about the stance in developing China-US relations," Hua said.Hua said that China is glad to see Russia and the US improving relations and hope the two countries enhance communication and widen cooperation, which will benefit world peace and development.Putin and Trump met for two hours on Monday, with Trump saying they would discuss "everything from trade to military, to missiles to China," USA Today reported. US media said that through the summit, the US and Russia would seek to build an alliance, which would worry China."There is the very real possibility that the stars could align on Russia's and the US' side to take on China in the future," said an article on the website of the American Conservative on Monday. CNBC on Monday quoted John Ferguson, director of global forecasting at analysis firm Economist Intelligence Unit, as saying that "nearby superpower China will be paying the most attention to the relationship dynamic between the two leaders."However, Chinese experts dismissed the opinions."It is necessary for Putin and Trump to talk about China, because China is important. But it does not mean that Russia and the US are seeking ways to confront China," Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday.Trump is confident in simultaneously befriending China and Russia, although it is different from the traditional and ruling ideology supported by the US establishment elites and media, Li noted."For Putin and Russia, China is still a more active and effective partner," Li said, adding that Putin surpasses Trump in terms of political experience and wisdom, so Putin understands the situation better."Putin will not answer his call. The strategic partnership between China and Russia is stable," Li Xing, director of the Eurasian Studies Center at Beijing Normal University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Limited changeAfter meeting Putin, Trump tweeted that "I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people. However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past - as the world's two largest nuclear powers, we must get along!"However, experts believe that any change in Russia-US relations through one summit will be very limited.Since Trump holds different views from his diplomatic and security team, as well as the US mainstream, his personal expectations toward Putin will hardly make a dent on US policy toward Russia, Li Haidong said."Trump sees the situation in a simplistic way. He will be restrained by the powers behind him," he said."Russia and the US have structural problems. The meeting merely relieves the atmosphere," Li Xing said, "Negotiating is a good start."Newspaper headline: Putin-Trump summit won’t affect ties with China: FM Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Why West is reluctant to invest in MyanmarChina hits back at 'irresponsible' report over Belt and Road projectsChina hits brakes on urban rail projects to address debt How California can prevent a water crisisLegal pot market undercutCleaning the beach How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
