A Tibet Autonomous Region government program has trained more than 1,000 talented ethnic minority people in special job skills, a move that has boosted ethnic solidarity, social stability and development in the Southwest China region, Chinese experts said.The program, approved by the State Council and initiated in 2009, aims to develop local minority talent in in-demand fields including education, healthcare, engineering and culture in more than 150 colleges and vocational schools around China. Some 120 new participants enroll in the program every year. Some 1,080 program participants are finishing their study and returned to Tibet to work, Tibet-based news website xzxw.com reported on Tuesday. The program will provide more opportunities for communication and cooperation in the future, the website said.Some 56 experts and scholars from other parts of the country have also visited Tibet during the last nine years, and provided lectures and related education services in Tibet to more than 3,200 local people, according to the report."Talent cultivation among minorities has a significant meaning for the development of Tibet," Xiong Kunxin, an ethnic studies professor at Tibet University in Lhasa, told the Global Times on Wednesday.The program should continue and be further optimized so that more ethnic minority people can receive better education, and, in return, contribute to the development of Tibet, Xiong noted.During the program, students from Tibet have actively communicated with other students in activities such as lectures, seminars and art performances on topics such as Tibetan medicine, culture and tourist attractions, xzxw.com reported."Introducing the culture of Tibet during educational communications is important in terms of promoting ethnic unity and maintaining social stability," said Xiong.Communications between people of different ethic groups can be further boosted during these events, Xiong asserted.
