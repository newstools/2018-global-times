Nobel laureate Yang Zhenning's remarks questioning the country's lack of top scientists have sparked wide discussions about China's ability on scientific innovation amid the ongoing trade friction between China and the US. Yang's comment echoed a question raised by Qian Xuesen, the "father of Chinese rocketry and space technology," in 2005, "Why do China's schools always fail to develop outstanding talent?"It is worth discussing "whether China is unsuccessful in cultivating top talent, whether there is anything that can improve the situation and whether it is important to work on the issue," Yang said at the 20th anniversary of the Fundamental Science Class of Tsinghua University, the Beijing News reported. The answer to all these questions is "Yes," Jin Xianmin, a professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University's School of Physics and Astronomy, told the Global Times on Monday.Jin said the younger generation of Chinese scientists should be given more resources and chance to deepen their studies. Programs like "The Thousand Talents Plan" was good but more efforts are needed, Jin stressed.The discussion comes amid trade friction between China and the US, which prompted China's academic sector to discuss ways to train more students to help make the country more independent and innovative in core technologies. China has been reflecting on its core scientific research capabilities, especially on domestic chips, after Chinese smartphone maker ZTE was caught in the crossfire of the trade frictions and was banned from buying US processors. Gu Binglin, dean of Tsinghua University's Institute for Advanced Study, noted that talent development should be mission-driven rather than assignment-driven. China's research environment has brought unnecessary pressure to younger researchers to achieve immediate results, Jin said. He called for a more diverse and inclusive attitude.
