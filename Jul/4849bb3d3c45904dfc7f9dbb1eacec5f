Chinese President Xi Jinping returned to Beijing on Sunday after visiting the Middle East and Africa, with officials and experts saying that the trip has deepened South-South cooperation and upheld multilateralism, especially among emerging economies.Xi left Mauritius on Saturday, the last stop of his 11-day trip to countries in the Middle East and Africa, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Senegal, Rwanda and South Africa. He also attended the 10th BRICS summit in Johannesburg.Xi's visit "opens new prospects for South-South cooperation and promotes the building of a community with a shared future for mankind," Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi was quoted as saying in a Foreign Ministry release on Sunday."Xi's visit would also help deepen South-South cooperation, uphold multilateralism and protect global exchanges, especially among rising economies," Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times.Li said that as trade frictions between China and the US linger, the fruitful achievements during this trip also showed that aside from markets in developed countries, China also shares stable markets in emerging economies. Those who attempt to use protectionism to contain China will fail, he stressed. "Xi's trip to Africa will also help keep the momentum of the current close exchanges between China and Africa and also serves as a warm-up for the China-Africa summit in September," Li said.The Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) will be held in Beijing in September, the Xinhua News Agency reported.China-Africa friendshipWang also noted the fruitful achievements reached during Xi's trip to the countries, including the signing of a memorandum of understanding on implementing the Belt and Road initiative with the UAE and signing cooperation documents on the initiative with Senegal and Rwanda. Song Wei, an associate research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Sunday that the active involvement of African countries in the Belt and Road initiative would bring greater fairness, mutual benefit to future China-Africa cooperation."Previous China-Africa cooperation was mainly about China's assistance, with little involvement from local governments and enterprises. But agreements under the Belt and Road initiative, which were reached during Xi's visit, would help strengthen trade exchanges, infrastructure construction and financial cooperation. Productivity and cross-regional projects are also expected to be implemented," Song said.Wang added that Mauritius and China have agreed to sign a cooperation accord on the initiative at an early date.Song said that India has been involved for many years in Mauritius' development, and Indians are working in the Mauritius' service industry. China's closer cooperation with Mauritius would help promote local tourism, diversify the latter's economy and strengthen its economic security.Benign competition will exist between China and India in Mauritius, which could drive the local economy, Song said.Wang stressed that China-Africa cooperation is mutually beneficial, and it is groundless to call China's contributions to social development in Africa "neo-colonialism.""African leaders said that China is a trustworthy friend. Sowing discord will not change the China-Africa friendship. African countries know exactly who is a genuine friend… and they would like to work with China on realizing the African dream and Chinese dream," Wang said.In response to Western accusations that China is saddling poor nations with unsustainable debt through large-scale infrastructure projects that are not economically viable, Song said that China has offered non-reimbursable assistance or interest-free loans to African countries in the last 50 years to help them achieve self-development."Using debt crisis is a tactic some international multilateral organizations adopt to contain China… they also do this to African countries to apply pressure," Song said, adding that China will announce debt relief policies for some African countries.
