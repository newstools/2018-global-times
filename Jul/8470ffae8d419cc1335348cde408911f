A glittering "Eden Garden," located at the heart of the China-built Jinfei Economic, Trade & Cooperation Zone (Jinfei Zone) in western Mauritius, will symbolize the Indian Ocean archipelago's march toward modernity.Just like its name "Eden," this gleaming complex that blends Chinese architectural prowess with Africa's aesthetic beauty is a crown jewel that is a spectacle to behold.Its novel architectural design of symmetric and triangle elements towering into the sky in a simplified and modern expression presents a striking sense of power and grandeur, and its well-elaborated configuration in functionality of arts gallery, exhibition, wedding, KTV, cinemas, and open-air performance stands all in one.The Eden Garden Culture & Entertainment Square that will be unveiled in October this year straddles a huge swathe of the Jinfei Zone that happens to be the first smart city to be developed in Mauritius through a partnership with China.This world-class economic and trade zone that occupies 211 hectares of land is located 3.5 kilometers west of the Mauritian capital of Port Louis near some of the country's most iconic landscapes.Mauritius' dream of having an outstanding smart city will be realized in 2025 thanks to strategic harnessing of capital, technology and skills from China.It was in 2014 that the Mauritian government unveiled the Smart City Program in a bid to attract investments in high-tech industries, financial services, tourism and the blue economy.China's Shanxi Investments Group was invited to undertake the development of the Jinfei Zone, or Jinfei Smart City, in a region that was once a marshland.Hang Lianjun, the general manager of the Shanxi Investments Group, said reclaiming a marshland to put up a modern smart city was challenging but human ingenuity and determination finally ushered in positive outcomes."Through negotiations, we handed over roads, fences, pipe networks and other public and auxiliary facilities to the Mauritian government, which offset the rent of some land in the park, while reducing the continued investment and maintenance costs in the future," said Hang.A new master-plan for the Jinfei Zone, that was updated in 2016 and was endorsed by both Mauritian and Chinese governments, seeks to promote tourism, education, healthcare, and finance sectors by harnessing smart technologies.Hang said key activities at the Jinfei Zone like financial services and cultural tourism will be intelligently controlled.The establishment of a smart city in Mauritius which is alternately described as a shining pearl over the Indian Ocean will boost its position as a strategic link on the Belt and Road initiative.Lately, Chinese investors have demonstrated keen interest to invest in the Jinfei Zone.Lu Jixian, the managing director of China's Cinda Jinfei B&R Fund said Chinese companies have been attracted by Mauritius' economic competitiveness, friendly policies and strategic location to invest inside the new industrial park.The Jinfei Zone, that borrows heavily from the Chinese model of establishing smart cities to become financial services, technology and tourism hubs, has won accolades from Mauritius top leadership.
