File photo: ICThe trade row between China and the US is bringing challenges as well as opportunities for South China's Guangdong Province, which accounts for 25 percent of the nation's exports by value, experts said on Sunday. The province is home to a large number of leading Chinese enterprises with a technological edge and many manufacturers that thrive in the processing trade.The export-driven economy of the province has made it a focus of attention since the US kicked off a trade war with China on July 6.Bai Ming, deputy director of the International Market Research Institute under the Ministry of Commerce, said although its impact is still unfolding, the trade row will erode some of Guangdong's growth and export earnings, and it could hasten the process of manufacturers relocating to emerging markets such as neighboring Vietnam."The challenge to Chinese labor-intensive industries by those countries has been there for some time and it could be expedited by the trade row," Bai said.So far, data suggest that the impact of the trade row has been contained. According to figures released by Guangdong's statistical authority on July 24, the province's first-half export value declined 3.3 percent year-on-year to 1.91 trillion yuan ($280.5 billion).By category, general trade grew 7.1 percent to 928.5 billion yuan while processing trade with supplied materials posted a 10.7 percent decline to 67.11 billion yuan, the data showed.Li Xueying, an employee with Guangzhou-based Topmax Furniture Co, said so far her company has seen no impact from the trade row, noting that the US market accounted for about 5 percent of its business. Li's company makes chairs used in outdoor events and other dining facilities.Bai said opportunities will arise when cities in Guangdong Province better coordinate with each other and with Hong Kong, as part of the development of the Greater Bay Area, and as they develop new markets such as those along the routes of the Belt and Road initiative."Middle-end companies and their products occupy a good niche and are very hard to replace, given their partial technological edge, their economies of scale and the more complete industrial chain enjoyed by Chinese companies," Bai told the Global Times.Zhang Monan, research fellow with the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said that beyond gains or losses in export revenues, Guangdong is a microcosm of how China should cope with the trade row, which is aimed at not just at a trade balance but also at containing China's rise as a global technological power."Guangdong's low-end manufacturing is in the process of upgrading, but its companies still don't have the many core technologies needed for the transformation to be successful. Given the underlying intention of the US' punitive trade actions, China should realize that it's at a crossroads, where the traditional way of learning advanced technologies by working and cooperating with Western companies now faces  some difficulty."Meanwhile, China cannot master all the core technologies on its own, given the structure of the global industrial value chain," Zhang told the Global Times. "China needs to make a plan and set up a system that resolutely places innovation at the core of its industrial competitiveness."Newspaper headline: Challenges, opportunities for Guangdong amid trade row Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Trade war causing a real impact on US economyDubai plans to expand Chinese saltwater rice into Arab world, AfricaUS intensifies military presence in Indo-Pacific The public should act to protect US child stars in MeToo eraUS farmers voice concern In action How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
