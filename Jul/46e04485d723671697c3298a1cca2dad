Some Indian media commentators interpreted visits of Indian and Chinese leaders to Rwanda on successive days as evidence of "tough competition" in Africa, a standpoint that Chinese experts dismissed as "narrow-minded."Such opinions showed that "it is India that has an intention to offset China's cooperation in Africa and to gain a larger influence in the region," Hu Zhiyong, a research fellow at the Institute of International Relations of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday. India Today published an article on Sunday suggesting India and China were vying for Africa ahead of the BRICS summit in South Africa. Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Dakar on Saturday for a state visit to Senegal. He will also pay state visits to Rwanda and South Africa, and visit Mauritius during a stopover, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would begin his three-nation tour  Monday of Rwanda, Uganda and South Africa, the New Delhi-based newspaper reported.Both leaders will attend the 10th BRICS summit in Johannesburg on Wednesday.The India Today reported that the closely arranged visits signaled China and India are competing for strategic space in Africa.Although India has engaged extensively with major outreach initiatives in Africa, "Chinese, with their deep pockets, are a formidable competition in the region," the report said.India's Economic Relations Secretary TS Tirumurti said that India was not competing with China in Africa as "our relationship with Africa goes back to the time of Gandhi," he said."There is nothing bad about both leaders wanting to visit some other African countries ahead of the summit in South Africa, and China is glad to see more cooperation between India and African countries," He Wenping, a research fellow at the Institute of West Asian and African Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday.As developing countries and emerging powers, China and India should both contribute to the development of African countries, "which is the goal of south-south cooperation," He said. The Indian media's understanding was "narrow-minded," she said.Chinese government's data shows that China has helped build and is building more than 6,200 kilometers of railways in Africa, and China surpassed the US in 2009 to become Africa's largest trading partner. China's projects and cooperation conducted in Africa have focused more on infrastructure construction, while India participates more in education and medical fields. The roles played by the two countries in Africa "are more complementary than competitive," He said.
