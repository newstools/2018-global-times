A  report on the more than 10-year-long excavation of the Shangchen Historical Site, a Palaeolithic site in Northwest China's Shaanxi Province that has given archaeologists new insight into hominin evolution, was released in Nature, the British multidisciplinary scientific journal, on July 11.From 2004 to 2018, a total of 96 stone tools were excavated from the site by an international team consisting of experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Exeter and other major institutions around the world. Dating back some 2.12 million to 1.26 million years ago, these tools reveal that the region was occupied for a stretch of some 850,00 years. "Many stone tools were unearthed from a loess layer. The soil records the huge influence climate change had on the living environment as well as ancient culture," Zhu Zhaoyu, leading geologist for the project and a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, told the Global Times on Saturday.The oldest stone tools to be discovered outside of Africa, these findings provide evidence of the existence of early Homo erectus in Asia.Additionally, broken deer jawbones and animal fossils were unearthed as well, evidence that hunting was possibly taking place millions of years ago. "The stone tools mainly appeared during a time when the climate was humid and warm and the soil in good condition. Only a few were found in the loess during a period when the climate was cold and dry," Zhu said.According to Michael Petraglia, a paleoanthropologist from the Max-Planck Institute in Germany, this provides strong evidence that hominin migration out of Africa occurred earlier than previously thought. Previously, the earliest evidence of hominin activity outside Africa were the remains of Homo erectus found in Dmanisi, Georgia. The Dmanisi site dates to roughly 1.85 to 1.75 million years ago, 270,000 years older than the Shangchen site.The new discovery is also now the earliest hominin site inside China. The previous record holder was Yuanmou Man, excavated in Yuanmou County in Southwest China's Yunnan Province and dated to around 1.7 million years ago.Based on previous evidence, scientists theorized that early Homo erectus expanded from Africa to the other places around the world around 1.8 to 1.9 million years ago, however, the Shangchen site provides evidence that this occurred much earlier.Newspaper headline: New paradigm Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Wanna One's Kang Daniel beats out BTS to top S.Korean Best Idol list for 17 weeks straightConservatives in Catholic Church close ranks to stall dialogue with China, but won't succeed: analystsChina, Arab states agree to develop strategic partnership How California can prevent a water crisisLegal pot market undercutCleaning the beach How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
