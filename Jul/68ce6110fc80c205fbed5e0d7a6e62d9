A national work placement exchange meeting concerning the reemployment and welfare of veterans took place on Saturday, with experts calling for an expenditure increase for the group. The two-day meeting was held in North China's Hebei Province with representatives from 10 provincial regions and related government departments attended the meeting, Xinhua News Agency reported.It was emphasized during the meeting that current policies related to veteran's affairs should be implemented "without discount" and that more effort should be applied to reemployment, skill training and welfare for veterans to "make the profession of 'soldier' one that is respected by all of society," according to the report. Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan together with other senior officials attended the meeting, the report said.Service and management for retired servicemen have been conducted as important political goals during the past years in those regions."China has been developing so fast in recent years, making the resettlement of retired veterans an inevitable issue to solve," Su Wei, a professor at the Party School of the Communist Party of China Chongqing Committee, told the Global Times on Monday. In 2014, hundreds of veterans who served in battles or conflicts after the Korean War (1950-53) or in China's nuclear experiments demonstrated in Beijing, asking for better retirement benefits.Multiple reasons such as currency devaluation and industry upgrade have led to the dissatisfaction of some retired veterans, however, "this group of people should not be regarded as an unstable factor of society," Su said.To better the situation, Su suggests a more strict investigation into corruption cases from which more money can be obtained and used on the resettlement of veterans.China launched a project called "Action Zero Clearing" in February, promising to examine the situation of all soldiers who were demobilized after 1978 and who meet the job criteria. In March, the central government set up a ministry dedicated to dealing with veterans' affairs.
