Underage students in Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region must not take part in religious activities during the summer vacation, according to school regulations, with experts saying that the education law separates education from religious influences."We have sent notices to both students and their parents, and have had students sign an agreement that they will not take part in any form of religious activity during the summer vacation," Choephel, the head of the political education department at Lhasa Middle School, told the Global Times on Monday.The school reiterates the regulation every time in class meetings and parent-teacher meetings, not only before a vacation, he said.The students are following the regulation under the guidance of their parents and teachers, Choephel said, adding that the regulation was established under a guideline sent to primary and middle schools by Tibet's education department. Other schools in Tibet also have similar regulations under the guideline."China's education law separates education from religion, and that is the legal basis for the move," Xiong Kunxin, an ethnic studies professor at Tibet University, told the Global Times on Monday."The State separates education from religion. No organization or individual may make use of religion to conduct activities that interfere with the educational system of the State," China's Education Law states.Northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region also disallows underage students from taking part in religious activities, according to a document released by the State Council Information Office in 2016.Schools in Xinjiang reiterate the regulation throughout the year via notices and class meetings, Zhang Lijuan, a professor at Xinjiang Normal University's School of Marxism, told the Global Times on Monday."It is important to help young people set up a scientific outlook on the world and life," Zhang said.
