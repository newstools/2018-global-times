A Chinese court sentenced a former US football player to four years in jail for getting into a fight in a bar, with many Chinese netizens urging foreigners "to obey Chinese law when they are in China."Wendell Brown was sentenced to four years in jail following his arrest in September 2016 for his involvement in a bar fight in Southwest China's Chongqing Municipality."We continue to closely follow his case…Officers from the US Consulate in Chengdu regularly meet with counterparts in China's Public Security Bureau to ensure that detained US citizens are treated fairly under Chinese law," Scott C. Walker, US Embassy spokesperson, told the Global Times on Wednesday.On the night of September 24, 2016, some people at a nightclub threw a bottle at Brown and a quarrel followed, AP reported, adding that a local man accused Brown of seriously injuring his eye, which had to be removed. This sparked heated discussions on Chinese social media, with many netizens claiming the sentence is fair and that foreigners should also obey Chinese laws and regulations when in China.China's Criminal Law states that those who intentionally cause serious injury to a person will be sentenced to not less than three years and not more than 10 years in jail.The law says that the term "serious injury" includes loss of the use of a person's hearing, sight or function of any other organ. AP reported that the White House, the State Department and Michigan state officials have raised the case with China.
