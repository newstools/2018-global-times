While normally Chinese women are rarely the focus of European films, Bitter Flowers, a 2017 film directed by Belgian director Olivier Meys, tackles the struggles of Chinese streetwalkers in Paris.Starring Chinese actress Qi Xi, the film follows the story of a Chinese woman named Lina from Northeast China who bids temporary farewell to her husband and child at home to head to Paris in the hopes of making some money to start her own business back home. However, after failing to land a job in Paris due to language and cultural barriers, the desperate woman resorts to prostitution to make quick money. Receiving critical acclaim at several international film festivals in October 2017 and January this year, the coproduction between studios in Belgium, France, Switzerland, and China also received a warm welcome when it debuted in Belgian cinemas on March 28."The audience responded beyond our expectations, and the press was really unanimous about the quality of Olivier's work as well," the film's producers Valérie Bournonville and Joseph Rouschop told the Global Times via an email interview in late June.After an interview with Meys released on Chinese short video platform Yitiao in May, the film also started to gain attention from Chinese audiences. "Though I don't agree with many of the values shown in this film, I know they [sex workers] do exist in our society. It made me wonder how a foreign director could produce a film that is so well-illustrated," Chocolate Kingdom Xiaole, a Chinese blogger based in Europe who attended the film's red carpet premiere in Brussels in March, wrote on Chinese media review platform Douban."The heroine made a sacrifice for a better future for her husband and child… Chinese women's spirit of sacrifice is beyond what most people can imagine," commented Sina Weibo user Xiaobao Going Forward.True to lifeThe film is set in the 1990s, a time when provinces in Northeast China were undergoing major changes as the steel industry was overhauled and many workers lost their jobs. Lina, the focus of the film, represents the plight many laid-off women workers experienced. "At that time the life of many people took a new shift. In China that was a period of trying to take the best advantages of those changes, many people considered the possibility of starting their own business, or xia hai [Lit: enter the sea, also the film's Chinese title]," wrote Meys, who once lived in China for several years during the 2000s."The origin of those women's trips, going to Europe to find a quick way to make money in order to come back and start something, is taking roots in that period."Meys, who decided to tackle the Chinese story from an European angle, said the story was inspired by the "Dongbei [Northeast China] streetwalkers" that he bumped into on the street in Paris and "the courageous women who took a large part in the changes which happened [in China] and sometimes paid a large price."To ensure that the film was "as close as possible to the reality lived by those women," Meys and his team studied academic research, consulted with relevant NGOs such as Médecins du Monde and interviewed Chinese streetwalkers to hear their stories.There are more than 1,000 Chinese prostitutes in Paris, among them over a third have been in France for less than a year and 90 percent have children living in China, according to a Médecins du Monde survey in 2013. "We also visited the area where they came from... story, décor, costumes, props... all of those reflects reality," noted the director.After two years of research, Meys finished the script for the film with two other scriptwriters, including a Chinese writer, Zhou Amei, who was responsible for the Chinese dialogue. Tribute to Chinese women"The film is the story of a woman who is ready to put her present into parenthesis in order to assure the best future for her family; I see my film more as a tribute to Chinese women, their courage and sense of sacrifice," Meys told the Global Times.Starting his directing career while living in China, Meys holds a special feeling toward the country. "Now often when I think about an idea for a film, I want to place the action in China. There is such an energy flowing in your country that made myself very attracted to China," Meys wrote.But to him, Bitter Flowers is more than just a Chinese story."Bitter Flowers got a pretty good reception by European and American audiences, even if it is a Chinese story, with Chinese actors, speaking Chinese... but audience could find their way in it because the film has some universality in it," noted Meys, who sees it more as a universal human story.  Newspaper headline: ‘Bitter Flowers’ Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Can China-Myanmar Economic Corridor overcome hurdles to progress?China, India race for future technologies as Ambani beats Ma as Asia's richest man US think tank article blind to reality of China-US trade relationship 2 more defendants sentenced for Ji's murderInternational acceptance remains TCM's greatest challengeSelf-driving taxis to test in California How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
