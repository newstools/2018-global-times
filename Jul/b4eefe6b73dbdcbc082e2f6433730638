Later, the school faculty members in charge threatened those Chinese students declining to move out with failing academic grades.  The college later issued a statement online in response to the increasing public uproar ignited by such arrangements, "Student dormitories are the college's public resource, and it's normal to adjust dormitory arrangements." Shortly after that, a Weibo user going by the name tangruideshuo said that Shenyang City University demanded junior Chinese students  clean up foreign students' dorm buildings, to mark the school's "labor week" event. The foreign students who live in the dorm buildings were exempt from the activity.A junior student of the school was quoted by the news site thepaper.cn as saying that if a student does not show up and participate the cleanup, the student's credits will be reduced as punishment.An employee with the Shenyang school, surnamed Ma, defended the arrangement by saying that the students were only asked to work in public areas, and none inside any dorm rooms. Hype and hysteriaSome netizens complained that the schools are allowing foreign students with poor academic performance, and tolerating bad behavior from the students.In July, a Cameroonian student who was studying at Beijing's Tsinghua University was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment, with hefty fines and expulsion, after he was found to have swindled around 6 million yuan ($890,000 ) from his "Chinese girlfriend," according to the Beijing News.Liang Haiming, chairman of the China Silk Road iValley Research Institute, pointed out that certain schools in China indeed deliberately lower their admission bar to attract students from other countries.Liang warned that such preferential policies could establish the mistaken idea that only underperforming students come to China, and the elite go to the US and Europe. This mistaken idea could create bad blood between Chinese people and people from other countries, impairing the cultivation of high quality talent.Attracting talent In 2017, 489,200 international students furthered their studies in China, marking an increase of over 10 percent for the second consecutive year, said the Ministry of Education. The number of degree students reached 241,500 (49.38 percent of the total), up 15.04 percent year on year.Most international students came from South Korea, Thailand, Pakistan, the US, India, Russia, Japan, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Laos, in that order.It is inevitable for Chinese schools to follow an international path if they want to ascend to join the world's first-class colleges and universities, Xiong Bingqi, deputy director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, told the Global Times on Monday. However, Xiong noted that the reason why most Chinese schools set relatively low admission bars for foreign students is that Chinese schools at the present lag behind their international counterparts in terms of cultivating quality talent. Chinese schools should also stop distinguishing foreign students from Chinese ones, said Xiong, adding that they should to foster a truly diversified academic environment to inspire the genuine pursuit of knowledge and truth in China. Liang also suggested China should expand the number of programs for foreign students and offer courses that can better represent China and help these students' development, such as economics, finance and so forth.Newspaper headline: Guests as equals Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Washington's risky calculation of currency warWashington has Cold War instinct to make enemy of itselfChina-Russia ties can reduce dependence on US Lotus Festival 2 more defendants sentenced for Ji's murderInternational acceptance remains TCM's greatest challenge How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
