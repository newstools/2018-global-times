Experts slammed the move of some Chinese online platforms that feature fascist and militaristic content, saying they mislead young people.Netizens can easily reach fascist and militarist-themed music, which are uploaded by users on popular Chinese online music service providers including QQ Music and Netease Cloud Music, the Global Times found on Thursday.One of the music playlists called "Nazi Germany military songs" was tagged as "classics" and "encouraging." It was played more than 23,000 times.For example, the platforms feature the Nazi military marching song Erika and speeches delivered by Adolf Hitler. Pictures associated with the playlists usually involve the swastika, the Nazi salute, or Hitler himself.Songs sung by Japanese invaders during World War II can also be found, presented with Japanese military flags.On China's largest e-commerce platform Taobao, people can buy a replica Nazi uniform for 230 yuan ($35)."These are illegal, and the online platforms should also be responsible," Zhu Wei, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times on Thursday, citing China's Network Security Law.China does not have specific regulations banning fascist behavior or content, but the Network Security Law prohibits acts which promote ethnic hatred and discrimination online.Many netizens said they are "impressed.""I would definitely follow Hitler if I was born back then," says one comment under a Nazi song."Those who like these songs are mostly young people… Misleading them this way may cause huge social damage," Zhu warned.Young netizens tend to receive only fragmented information online and lack the context and perspective of history. So, China's education system should focus more on this part of history, Zhu said."They have a fascist image of wonderful uniforms, discipline, the uniformity of marching, saluting… but what they are missing is what's underneath all that. They don't see the destruction to parents, teachers, homes, culture and education," said Werner Reich, a Holocaust survivor, when asked about the Asian fetish for Nazi in February, South China Morning Post reported.A newly-adopted law on protecting heroes and martyrs bans acts which promote or glorify invasions, with offenders facing administrative or criminal penalties depending on the severity of their actions, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
