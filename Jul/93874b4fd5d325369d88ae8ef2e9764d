Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday sent congratulatory messages to African countries on the opening of the African Union (AU) summit, saying the organization is a banner of unity and strength and has actively pushed forward the process of African integration.Analysts said on Monday China has comprehensively strengthened its ties with Africa on development issues and security affairs, and they hope the only African country that has not established diplomatic ties with China may soon join the China-Africa family of friendship.Xi's message to the AU summit in Nouakchott, capital of Mauritania, was released on the Chinese Foreign Ministry's website on Sunday. Xi said that China will work together with Africa to support a number of development plans and initiatives including the Belt and Road, the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, Agenda 2063 of the AU, as well as other development strategies of African nations and push the China-Africa comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership to a new level.Comprehensive cooperationXi said that the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation will be held in September under the theme of China-Africa - Toward an Even Stronger Community with a Shared Future through Win-Win Cooperation.Experts said Xi's remarks indicate that China and the AU will strengthen their relations on economic development issues and security cooperation. Zhang Hongming, an expert on African studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that China-Africa relationships are based on strong complementarities - China needs access to overseas markets and resources and African nations need investment to spur their economic development.Zhang told the Global Times that the two sides may upgrade the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in an effort "to better serve higher-level cooperation." Major general Hu Changming, chief of the Office for International Military Cooperation at the Central Military Commission, said that China will continue to offer African countries assistance on military equipment, technology, talent and intelligence.Hu made the remarks at the opening of the first China-Africa Defense and Security Forum in Beijing, which began on June 26. The forum will run from June 26 to July 10. It is being hosted by China's Ministry of National Defense and attended by representatives of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and dozens of senior military officers as well as representatives from 50 African countries and the AU.Major general Brima Sesay, chief of the Defense Staff of Sierra Leone, said the forum has offered an opportunity "for us to share common ideas in solving security problems on the African continent in collaboration with China." Compared to Western countries, such as France and the US, which also have security ties with Africa, "China's approach is very clear, which is win-win," Colonel Ibrahim Yahye from the Air Force of Somalia, who attended the forum, told the Global Times."Western countries have launched projects in Africa, but they remain unfinished. I hope people can understand the difference between China's and other countries' approach in Africa," Yahye said.Only one leftWhile China and African countries continue to develop closer economic ties and security cooperation links, China hopes to further enhance diplomatic ties with some African countries, experts said.Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the resumption of diplomatic ties between China and Burkina Faso on May 26 signified a further step toward the goal of having all African nations establish formal relations with China, the Xinhua News Agency reported.Only the Kingdom of Eswatini, which was known as Swaziland until it changed its name in April, continues to have diplomatic ties with authorities on the island of Taiwan. "We sincerely hope this country will soon join the China-Africa family of friendship," Wang said."Taiwan will increase its input to the country since it is currently the only one it has ties in Africa," Zhang said. "There is no difficulty for the Chinese mainland to build diplomatic ties with the nation if it really wants to do so, because Taiwan's capability cannot compare to that of the Chinese mainland."The only comparable power in Africa is the US, but the US currently has little intention or desire to increase its input to the continent. So at present, no one can stop China in Africa, Zhang noted.Newspaper headline: Xi praises African Union Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Xi delivers clear message on rights to MattisNepal PM's China visit puts ties on a new roadIn 17 years, China grows from newcomer to experienced player in WTO World Cup should not be used for political endsUS court upholds travel banThe Color Run How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
