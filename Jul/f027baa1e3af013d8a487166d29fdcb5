As Pakistan transitions to its newly elected government, officials and analysts agree the new administration will further strengthen the country's already close bilateral ties with China, with areas of cooperation likely to be expanded beyond the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).Several days after its historic general election, which was won by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and prime minister in waiting Imran Khan, Pakistani officials and analysts said the China-Pakistan relationship transcends political parties. They listed a host of areas for potential new cooperation from security to economic and social development."You must understand that China-Pakistan cooperation is beyond governments. All governments in Pakistan and all governments in China have always supported this relationship,"said Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, director general of the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad, at a media event with Chinese reporters on Monday. "I see no reason for any concern that the Pakistan-China relationship will go down. In fact, it will go up."Khan has already indicated that his new government would further strengthen Pakistan's relations with China. In a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing on Sunday, Khan said that the PTI attaches great importance to the relationship with China and is willing to learn from China in areas such as anti-corruption, poverty alleviation, environmental protection and urban development, according to a statement from the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad."After the PTI assumes office, it will fully coordinate with China and promote the persistent development and deepening of the bilateral relations," Khan told the Chinese ambassador.Despite recent media reports raising concerns and suspicion over the CPEC, a massive development program under the China-propsed Belt and Road inititaive that covers infrastructure, energy and port construction, Khan reaffirmed his commitment to the projects.While the government transition will still take some time, Pakistan's commitment to the CPEC will remain intact because of the great benefits they will bring to the peoples of Pakistan and China, said Pakistani Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua."CPEC has achieved significant success and has enjoyed across-the-board political support over the last few years and will continue to be a priority... when the new government comes in power," Janjua said during a briefing with Chinese reporters in Isalambad, adding that recent critcism of CPEC has been instigated by parties with ulterior motives.Expanding cooperationIn addition to existing cooperation projects under CPEC, there are many areas Pakistan and China could seek further cooperation, such as education, science and technological development, according to Janjua, who added that Pakistan could further learn from China's economic development model.Janjua also reaffirmed that Pakistan's long-standing support of the one-China policy and other core issues such as the South China Sea.Geopolitical factors also require China and Pakistan to further strengthen cooperation considering the changing policies of the US toward Pakistan and India, Pakistani analysts said."Unfortunately, at this given time, US policy is such that it has put Pakistan on a different side of America's interests," Khalid Mahmood, chairman of the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad, told reporters on Monday, adding that under such circumstances, China and Pakistan should further strengthen their partnership and coordination on issues."Our relationship is based on principles - principles of peaceful coexistence, and what's more, this relationship enjoys popular support," Mahmood said.
