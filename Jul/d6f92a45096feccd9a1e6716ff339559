The Communist Party of China (CPC) will hold a conference with leaders of African political parties and organizations to learn about development and peace from each other, an expert said.
The Africa conference of the CPC in Dialogue with World Political Parties High-level Meeting will be held from July 17 to 18 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The conference will explore the theory and practice of the road to development that conforms to national conditions, with about 40 leaders of African political parties and organizations participating, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Thursday.
"The CPC and African political parties will learn from each other in terms of development and peace," Su Wei, a professor at the CPC Chongqing Committee's Party School, told the Global Times on Thursday.
"China is a step ahead when it comes to reform and development, so Africa can learn a lot from China," Su said. But he added that China is not exporting a Chinese model, as China follows an independent foreign policy.
African political parties are willing to have a conversation with China because China treats every country and political party equally, Su noted.
