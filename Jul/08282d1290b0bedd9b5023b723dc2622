Japan's new type Aegis destroyer with its Co-operative Engagement Capability (CEC) system will break water on Monday, potentially targeting China and threatening other countries according to Chinese experts. Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the People's Liberation Army Naval Military Studies Research Institute, told the Global Times on Sunday that CEC was developed by the US Navy to strengthen its maritime air defense capability.Every ship within the network created by the system can share in real-time movements of enemy targets as well as the battlefield situation, he said. The warship in the best position can then be selected to intercept weapons when needed and thus improve anti-air capabilities.The 27DDG-class is the seventh Aegis destroyer in the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, Japan-based News Jiji Press reported. Expected to enter service by 2020, the unnamed destroyer is the first Japanese ship to be equipped with CEC. CEC will strengthen intelligence data sharing with the US, Zhang said, and strengthen their military alliance. From the US perspective, it can better control Japan, Zhang said.Although allegedly aimed at North Korea, CEC also targets China, he said. "Once absolute security is realized by Japan and the US, they could attack other countries without scruples," Zhang said, "which will certainly destabilize other regions."
