Marco Bellei, a former opera coach and chorus master working with top European theaters, made a huge career move that led to him spending nearly a decade at a local college in Xinxiang, a small city in Central China's Henan Province.After nine years of helping to establish the foundation of the music education system in Henan, Bellei accepted an invitation in 2017 to work as a professor of opera at the Central Conservatory of Music, China's top music university."The experience of making contributions to fundamental education and elite cultivation in Chinese music has been really satisfying," Bellei told the Global Times in an interview on May 15. A life-changing decisionBellei did not know how his life would change after he decided to accept the offer from Henan Normal University to teach at its music department. Born in the northern Italian city of Modena, Bellei graduated from the country's Vecchi Academy there with a PhD in piano and two master degrees for conducting and composing in 1992.Afterwards, Bellei was an active member of the global opera community as a coach, conductor and chorus master, working with top musicians such as Zubin Metha, Claudio Abbado and Luciano Pavarotti.From his more than 20 years working in the field, Bellei gained rich and valuable teaching experience.Bellei wasn't a complete stranger to China when he accepted the offer. Back in 2005, he traveled to China to deliver a master class during which he visited Beijing, Shanghai and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and was amused by how China was different from what he had learned about in books.Three years later, he returned to China for another master class. It was during this trip that he received the job offer from Henan Normal University."So I stopped my contracts and work in theaters in Italy because I wanted to come to China," Bellei said.This passion to head somewhere new proved useful as he faced challenges after he arrived. "Henan, comparing with developed regions in China, the education resources on music was very inadequate," Bellei said.In a university of such a small city, some of Bellei's students couldn't even read musical notation. "It was a very different time for me," he told the Global Times. Revamping education The difficulties he encountered did not stop Bellei. The first step he took was to meet with music teachers from universities throughout Henan to get an idea of what needed to be done to improve basic music and opera education in the province.Next, he and his students began putting together a performance of Henan's first-ever Western opera Gianni Schicchi by Puccini, which they managed to bring to the stage after a few months. In 2009, just a year after he began working at the university, the Bellei-directed Henan Normal University choir beat out many prestigious professional choirs to win the Chinese Golden Bell Award for Music, a nation-level pop music award.Seeing everything the university had achieved, the Henan education ministry began supporting Bellei's efforts, which enabled the opera veteran to bring his students to bigger stages.In 2009, he adapted the famous comic opera L'elisir d'amore into a Henan dialect-version featuring local cultural elements. Directed by China's top stage director Tang Muhai, the performance eventually made its way to the Shanghai Oriental Theatre in 2010. In September 2013, Bellei's troupe performed Oedipus Rex at the Tianjin Grand Theatre.In June 2016, Bellei and his students performed the Song Cycles of Long March, a symphonic and choral concert, as part of celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the Long March (1934-35). "This performance was a gift from me to China," he said.Later that year, the provincial government awarded Bellei with the Excellent Teacher of Henan Province award."To be honest I had never thought I would be in Henan for nine years. But one project after another, I gradually established roots there and became a part of China," Bellei said.In 2013, Bellei married a local Henan woman, further cementing his ties with the province. He hopes that at some point in the future he will be able to get a Chinese "green card."He said that he learned the spirit of education from famed opera veteran Pavarotti during their four years working together. "He liked teaching students and gave them hope, which also inspired me to help young people."Some of his students' lives have certainly been changed by Bellei's efforts.Many of his students now serve as choral members in the National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA) and other big theaters or study music abroad.Supporting music eliteWhen Bellei received the offer to work at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing in the summer of 2017, he decided it was time to return to professional music circles."With my task of establishing a basic music education system finished, I wanted to devote my knowledge and power to supporting the music elite," he said.Currently, Bellei is a supervisor for the conservatory's Opera Artistic Directing major - the first such doctoral program in China - and the conductor of the Philharmonic Male Choir of the Chinese Musicians Association.From March 14 to 18, the opera Daughter of the Regiment was performed at the NCPA with Bellei acting as the chorus's director."Opera is maturing very quickly in China. China can continue to grow more because it is very young when it comes to [Western] music, and a little spark kindles a great fire," he said."I hope more foreigners can come to China to understand China and help develop it together," Bellei said.Newspaper headline: Rising to the challenge Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Time for China to cool Sino-Australian tiesChina welcomes Trump's assurance of NK securityIndia's largest public sector bank posts highest-ever loss Flying taxis face many hurdles before public use in major citiesCA governor's race heats upTour of California How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
