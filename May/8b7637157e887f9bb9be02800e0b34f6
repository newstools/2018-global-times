Correcting perceptions is a fundamental guarantee of sound and sustainable development for Sino-Australian relations, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday, after a meeting between the two countries' foreign ministers in Argentina on Monday.In response to a question raised by a Global Times reporter during the regular briefing on Tuesday, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that as indicated in Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's statement, it was essential to address "perception issues before developing bilateral ties between China and Australia." Meeting his Australian counterpart Julie Bishop on the sidelines of the G20 foreign ministers' conference in Buenos Aires on Monday, Wang said China urged the Australian side to "take off its tinted glasses" and make efforts to push forward bilateral cooperation rather than dampen the prospect of relations.  Bishop characterized the talks, which went on for more than an hour, as "warm, candid and constructive," according to Australian Financial Review.The Australian minister, who has not visited China for more than two years, also said she would soon visit Beijing, the Sydney-based newspaper reported. Wang said he looked forward to hosting their annual bilateral talks. The report did not reveal any specific schedule. "Bishop's positive statement on China could be makeshift rhetoric to earn domestic support for coming elections unless Canberra follows it up with actions, " Yu Lei, a research fellow at the Oceania Research Center of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong Province, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday The Guardian newspaper reported Bishop objected to China's "militarization of the South China Sea," and confirmed she had raised objections to China's activities in the South China Sea, including the "weekend incident." "China's military drills within its own territory are rightful and in accordance with international norms and laws," Yu said. "Evidently, Canberra is still using a double standard against China's legitimate development, as it is being self-contradictory by campaigning for a crackdown on foreign interference domestically and at the same time dishing dirt on China's internal affairs," he said.
