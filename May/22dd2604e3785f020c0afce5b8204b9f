China's Ministry of National Defense (MOD) said Chinese first aircraft carrier, Liaoning, has achieved systemic combat readiness, with military experts saying this means the Chinese navy possesses an aircraft carrier strike group capable of engaging in combat missions with other units far from China's territory. After a series of training missions, including distant-sea combat trainings, the Liaoning has "achieved systemic combat capability," Ministry of National Defense spokesperson Ren Guoqiang said at a routine press conference on Thursday."Systemic combat capability means the aircraft carrier has formally integrated into a large system or network for joint military operations, which consists of satellites, aircraft, ground forces, marines, submarines and other naval vessels," said Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator. The aircraft carrier is the strike group's core, and with help from ground-based, air-based and space-based units, the strike group will have the comprehensive combat capability to conduct military operations in distant seas, Song noted.
