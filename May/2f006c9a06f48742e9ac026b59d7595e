Fallen cyberspace administration chief Lu Wei is being used as a warning to eliminate threats to the political security of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in provincial anti-corruption campaigns, which a Chinese expert said would deter violators ahead of personnel changes.East China's Anhui Province asked Party members and officials to use Lu as a negative example, to keep clean and being firmly loyal to the Party, according to a release from the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) on Sunday. Lu, the former deputy head of the publicity department of the CPC Central Committee and former head of the Cyberspace Administration of China, was expelled from the Party and dismissed from public office for offenses including bribery, the Xinhua News Agency reported in February. Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and South China's Guangdong Province also launched similar education campaigns with Lu as the poster boy on April 26 and May 4 respectively, according to local media reports.Dealing with Lu's case after the 19th CPC National Congress "was completely right and timely" and has helped "eliminate hidden threats, which would jeopardize the political security of the CPC and the country," Heilongjiang Daily reported in April.Political construction "should be the priority for the warning education," the report said. Lu Wei not only took bribes but lost his faith, Su Wei, a professor at the Party School of the Chongqing Committee, told the Global Times on Monday. "Lu's deeds also led to a loss of values which can do enormous harm."Campaigns like these are carried out every year, Su noted, but this year's have special meaning as personnel changes are coming with their associated temptations."Given the institutional reform following the Third Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, personnel changes for officials are now underway, which could tempt them to go corrupt," said Su, adding that education would deter violators.
