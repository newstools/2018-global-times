Beneficial 16+1 cooperationChinese Premier Li Keqiang led a welcome ceremony in Beijing for Merkel's visit to China on Thursday. Before the ceremony, Li and Merkel met over breakfast, exchanging views on Sino-German and Sino-European relations, among other issues, according to information posted on the State Council's website.Li and Merkel also mentioned the "16+1 cooperation," which refers to China's cooperation with 16 Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC). Li said the 16+1 cooperation is a "beneficial supplement" to the EU, and will help the EU reduce gaps among member states on economic development to better realize integration, CCTV reported.Merkel agreed with Li and said that the 16+1 cooperation is a beneficial platform, and the cooperation between China and CEECs will not divide the EU, CCTV reported. Some conservative European politicians and scholars are concerned that the 16+1 cooperation will damage EU unity. But as the leader of the EU, Germany will make wise judgments, said Wang Yiwei, director of the Renmin University of China's Institute of International Affairs.China is bringing economic development opportunities to CEECs that other EU members didn't offer. So if the EU wants to maintain internal unity, it should be open-minded and supportive of the 16+1 cooperation, Wang noted.Li and Merkel also met leaders and representatives of high-tech firms, including automobile and IT industries such as China's Geely Automobile, Huawei and Germany's Siemens on Thursday, CCTV reported. Li said during the meeting that China will open its financial sector to foreign participation and reduce China's joint venture requirements in sectors such as automobiles, and urged Germany to offer equal market access.
