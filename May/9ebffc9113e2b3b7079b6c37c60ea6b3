China's first domestically-developed medium-speed maglev train passed a test run on Wednesday using innovative technology, and is expected to serve the Belt and Road initiative.The prototype of the new train, jointly developed by four organizations and companies, including the National University of Defense Technology and CRRC Tangshan Co Ltd (CRRC Tangshan), completed a successful test run in Changsha, Central China's Hunan Province, according to a statement sent by CRRC Tangshan to Global Times on Wednesday.The train, with a designed speed of 160 kilometers per hour, uses a hybrid suspension involving both electromagnets and permanent magnets for the first time, which can save 20 percent of power while enhancing traction by at least 10 percent compared to the low- to medium-speed trains currently in operating in China. The statement called it a "milestone" for an advanced rail transportation project under China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20). The train can be operated by a ground control unit and a location detection system can accurately locate the train.The medium-speed train will be applied to city-to-city transportation or within urban areas, which could also be a transport solution for China's urbanization and international cooperation in the Belt and Road initiative, CRRC said."The successful test provides an important technical foundation for the next generation train with a speed of 200 kilometers per hour, which is expected to roll off the assembly line next year," Wu Kechao, head of the CRRC Tangshan publicity department, told the Global Times on Wednesday.China is also developing a 600 kilometer per hour train, the prototype of which will be launched around June 2020, Changjiang Times reported in 2016.Newspaper headline: ‘Milestone’ homegrown medium-speed maglev train passes trial run Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Time for China to cool Sino-Australian tiesChina welcomes Trump's assurance of NK securityIndia's largest public sector bank posts highest-ever loss Flying taxis face many hurdles before public use in major citiesCA governor's race heats upTour of California How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
