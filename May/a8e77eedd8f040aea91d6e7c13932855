Guiyang, capital of Southwest China's Guizhou Province, is ramping up efforts to build its "Big Data Valley," while analysts said the city's future will depend on development of local talent, government policy continuity, and long-term industrial upgrading.In January, the city released plans to develop a Big Data Valley by 2020, aiming to store up to 1 exabyte (1 billion gigabytes) of data and construct over 10 competitive and influential big data brands by that time. Recently, the efforts have been boosted again by the 2018 China International Big Data Industry Expo, which was held in Guiyang from Saturday to Tuesday.During the Expo, tech giant Tencent  Holdings announced it had signed an agreement with the local government of Guiyang to help develop the Big Data Valley plan, according to a statement Tencent sent to the Global Times on Monday.Pony Ma, CEO of Tencent, also announced that the tech company's Qixing data center in the Gui'an New Area near Guiyang "will store the company's most important data in the future." The center has begun its trial operation, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday. "A data center has to be established in a place with plenty of land, a relatively low temperature and, preferably, low electricity costs. [Guizhou] happens to possess all these advantages," Li Yi, a senior research fellow at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences' Internet Research Center, told the Global Times on Tuesday.So far, China's three major telecom carriers, as well as companies like Apple, Huawei, Tencent, and Foxconn have built core data centers in the province. However, despite all this progress, experts noted that the main reason for the arrival of major companies, including foreign investors, is preferential government policies, and China's ambition to transform the city into a "data center.""But the support and policies have to be consistent. For example, the low cost of land, government subsidies and other benefits have to be retained over the long term," Xiang Yang, an industry analyst with Beijing-based CCID Consulting, told the Global Times on Tuesday.He also noted that the lack of local talent is a problem.Long-term development An industry insider who talked on condition of anonymity warned that in the short term, the gathering of data centers might not bring much economic benefit or job creation for Guiyang, since "all the business related to the data center does not happen anywhere near the center." "A data center is just a place for the purpose of storage. It's all remote access and only has a small number of employees," the insider told the Global Times on Tuesday, adding that for Google to operate a data center, it only needs around 100 employees."Data centers are actually in the downstream part of the whole industry, and they generate quite limited profits. Thus the goal of building a data valley is not a tough one to achieve," Li told the Global Times.How to pursue industrial upgrading in the long term is more significant for the city, according to Li.Newspaper headline: Guiyang eyes data dream Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Social credit system must bankrupt discredited people: former official B&R needs broader supportCCTV camera maker brands latest US bill as 'groundless' Flying taxis face many hurdles before public use in major citiesCA governor's race heats upTour of California How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
