It was 3:30 pm on Friday, and young parents and old grandparents were standing in long lines in front of the gate of a primary school on Guanghua Lu in Beijing's Chaoyang district, waiting to pick up their little "princess" or "prince." Born under the one-child policy, the 1980s generation is said to have been spoiled by their parents, and as more and more of them marry, a younger generation is growing up under their care.For this year's International Children's Day, Metropolitan interviewed 10 children born to parents from the 1980s generation to get their thoughts on their family members and themselves.

Colorful school lifeSchool officially closes at 3:30 pm on Fridays, but a few kids still remained after the crowd left. Some of their parents were late in picking them up, and others had extracurricular activities. The school's security guard told Metropolitan that there was an after-school reading class which finishes at 4:30 pm and basketball training which ends at about 5 pm as the reporters watched the busy scene in which a group of students, mostly girls, exercised on the playground under the guidance of a foreign basketball teacher. At about 5 pm, a group of little girls wearing princess dresses exited a nearby kindergarten with their parents. A parent told Metropolitan that the children just finished rehearsing a play to celebrate Children's Day.The minute the Metropolitan reporters set up their cameras, these little princesses immediately became alert and started competing for time in front of the lens, shouting, "Film me! Film me!" Without even the smallest hint of shyness or nervousness, they gave an almost professional catwalk show in front of the camera.During the Two Sessions this year, Minister of Education Chen Baosheng said that the ministry has started to solve the "3:30 pm issue," so named because it is the time when most schools end, but many parents are still working and unable to pick up their children. Chen said that over the past year, many effective measures have been implemented in the different provinces to solve the issue and that they are still working on further improvements. He gave an example that in Beijing, the measures include mainly setting up extracurricular activities for children after 3:30 pm.Still pressuredCompared with their parents, the 1980s generation had much more opportunities to enter a university to pursue higher education. They are also no stranger to the pressure coming from taking the gaokao (national college entrance exams) and the importance of knowledge in changing one's fate. Though the country has been promoting lessening the pressure on students for years, it seems that the 1980s generation parents do not really give their children a big relief.A seven-year-old girl told Metropolitan that her only wish on Children's Day is that her parents can take her on a trip, no matter where they go. "I do homework from Monday to Sunday," she said. When Metropolitan asked several kindergarten children what they consider a big deal, one girl said studying is a big deal.In Chinese families, girls are often treated like little princesses, while boys may have to abide by stricter rules. An example of this was visible on the school grounds when everyone was leaving - a little boy was disciplined by his father near the school gate for not being well-behaved at school. When asked what he would like his parents to change, the little boy replied in front of his father that he hoped his parents would beat him less.Another boy who was being picked up by his grandma had a similar response. "I hope my parents do not beat my bottom anymore," he said.Almost all the little girls interviewed said that they don't think their parents needed to change because their parents are already very good, and their wishes for Children's Day were mainly about their "princess dream." They hoped their moms would buy them earrings, jewelry, jewelry boxes, beautiful dresses, and so on.More thoughtful and self-awareWith the relaxing of the one-child policy, some of the kids born after 2010 are not the only child in their family. Among the 10 interviewed, three of them have a sibling.When asked whether they want to send a greeting to their family, one apologized to her younger sister, acknowledging that she knows she should not beat her. Another girl said that she wants to tell her younger brother that he should follow in her footsteps and be a good child when growing up.Traditionally, Chinese grandparents would be responsible for taking care of their grandchildren. More than half of the people who came to pick up the students on Friday were grandparents. One old lady told Metropolitan that her son and daughter-in-law are so busy with their jobs that she almost single-handedly raised her grandson. Kids born after 2010 are also more self-aware and pick up a lot more about their surroundings and the people around them. Although young, many of them have started to show their filial piety. A seven-year-old girl expressed her wish that her mom cook more so that her grandma won't have to work so hard to take care of her and her younger brother.
