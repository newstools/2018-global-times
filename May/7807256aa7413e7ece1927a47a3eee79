China is promoting its seawater rice in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, hoping to help feed more people in countries with large portion of saline-alkaline land, the research team told the Global Times on Tuesday.  A total of 176 breeds of seawater rice are being tested on five types of saline-alkaline land in China, including Kashgar in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Daqing in Heilongjiang Province, Dongying and Qingdao in Shandong Province and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province. A saline and deteriorating farmland in Yan'an, Shaanxi Province is another test ground for the seawater rice, CCTV reported. Researchers will screen better rice breeds suitable for different climates and various degrees of salinity and alkalinity, Zhang Guodong, the deputy director of the Sea-Rice Research and Development Center in Qingdao, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The seawater rice along with its standard planting technique can be widely promoted across China in 2020 after the first national standard seawater rice breed was approved in 2019, Zhang said. Seawater rice or salt-alkali-tolerant rice is designed to grow in tidal flats and saline-alkaline land and can survive after being immersed in seawater. The project was led by Yuan Longping, who has been dubbed as China's "father of hybrid rice."Aside from China, the team is also considering promoting seawater rice in Middle Eastern countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, and Southeast and South Asian countries, including Vietnam, Sir Lanka and India, Zhang told the Global Times. "We hope to get financial support under the Belt and Road initiative framework for a 100 hectare of seawater rice experimental plot in the desert of Dubai, which will start planting at the end of June," Zhang said, adding that "some Chinese banks in Dubai expressed their willingness to finance our project."By 2020, seawater rice fields are projected to cover 10 percent of Dubai's territory. China and the UAE plan to jointly promote seawater rice in the Middle East and northern African countries by establishing a seawater rice promotion center, Zhang added.Experimental seawater rice planted in January in Dubai is expected to yield more than 500 kilograms per mu, the Science and Technology Daily reportedFrom the end of 2018 to early 2019, the Chinese team will introduce seawater rice and planting techniques to Vietnam, whose land has long suffered from the seeping of sea water. "Sir Lanka and India are also two nations that China plans to cover, but discussions have yet to begin," Zhang said. Li Xinqi, a research fellow at the China National Hybrid Rice R&D Center, told the Global Times that seawater rice is vital to China's food security. If the technique spreads across the world, it will also largely contribute to their food supply as part of China's agricultural "Go Out" strategy."If the seawater rice expands to 100 million mu with the lowest rate of 300 kilograms per mu, rice production would increase by another 30 billion kilograms, and 80 million more people could be fed," Yuan told CCTV.
